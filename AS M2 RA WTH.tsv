And so, Megan, you know, we're kind of, we're kind of strangers.	Others
I mean, I think we don't know each other well.	Others
No.	Others
Just barely met.	Others
And so, uhm, ah, I would just like to try to be of some help in some way, if you want that, uhm, in our time together.	Others
And, ah, I'd like you to start if you could just tell me some of your goals, if, if you have some.	Others
In my life right now? Goals in your life right now.	Others
Goals, or, you know, let's say you can make a wish.	Others
Okay.	Others
Maybe three wishes.	Others
Heck, five wishes.	Others
No, no, three wishes is enough.	Others
Three wishes for ways that you might change or improve yourself.	Others
Myself.	Others
Myself as a person, or myself physically or just me? Any way you wanna answer that.	Client Details
Ahh.	Client Details
Well, my first one would probably be, I don't know, able to predict my future.	Client Details
Okay.	Client Details
You know, just see where I'll end up.	Client Details
You'd like to know where you ended up in the future? Yeah.	Client Details
I got, I got an idea.	Client Details
But, you know.	Client Details
Yeah.	Client Details
some things happen and.	Client Details
What's your idea? Make a lot of money.	Client Details
Yeah? Yeah, and to have a nice house.	Client Details
You, and that's what you think is gonna happen? You're gonna make a fair amount of money? Yeah.	Client Details
And have a decent house? I should when I get, yeah, I should.	Client Details
Okay.	Others
Go ahead. Yeah.	Others
Umm.	Others
That's number one.	Chief Complaint
Yeah, that's number one.	Chief Complaint
My second, maybe my anger.	Chief Complaint
Okay.	Chief Complaint
My anger problem.	Chief Complaint
I have a little temper sometimes.	Chief Complaint
Okay.	Chief Complaint
It's out of control that I, ah, I'd, you know, just people, I'd just, people would make me mad.	Chief Complaint
You seem so relaxed and calm now, but what you're saying is that you, that, that sometimes? Sometimes.	Chief Complaint
people would.	Chief Complaint
not all the times.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
Sometimes people really tick you off.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
Okay.	Client Details
And, ah, the third one.	Client Details
Maybe I'd be still outgoing all the time, I don't know.	Client Details
I'm really outgoing and.	Client Details
Okay.	Client Details
you know, I just do weird things and people just get in, intimidated by, talking.	Client Details
sometimes, so I'm really outgoing.	Client Details
So the downside on that is you're so outgoing that sometimes it puts people off? Yeah.	Chief Complaint
And that.	Chief Complaint
Just like they don't wanna be around me cause I, you know.	Chief Complaint
you're too outgoing? Yeah, I'm too out, I'm too out there.	Chief Complaint
You know what I mean? Yeah.	Others
Do you understand? Okay.	Others
Very extroverted and very outgoing.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
And some people can't handle that very well.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
And it's just how I am.	Chief Complaint
I can't help it.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
I mean, I don't wanna change for other people.	Chief Complaint
Sure.	Chief Complaint
Never gonna happen.	Chief Complaint
You are who you are and that's a thing that you don't really need to, or you don't think you need to really wanna change.	Chief Complaint
Uh hmm.	Chief Complaint
So, of those three.	Others
Uh hmm.	Others
Okay? As much as I'd like to say I could help you make money.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
And tell your future, and foretell your future. Maybe we'll get to that.	Chief Complaint
Okay.	Chief Complaint
But, uhm, I think the easiest one for us to focus on would be the anger.	Chief Complaint
The anger.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
Uhm, because here's what my goal is.	Chief Complaint
My goal is to help you accomplish your goals as long as they're legal and healthy.	Chief Complaint
Okay.	Chief Complaint
Okay? All right.	Others
Fair enough? Yup.	Chief Complaint
Fair.	Chief Complaint
And I hear the anger one as being pretty legal and pre, well, pretty healthy.	Chief Complaint
So, Anger management, right? Yeah.	Others
Yeah.	Others
Okay.	Others
So tell me, I'm gonna, I'm gonna ask you some question about the anger stuff.	Chief Complaint
When is the first time, how old were you when you felt like, Ah, I got this temper or somebody told you you got a temper? Well, uhm, I have short-term memory.	Chief Complaint
So, I'm gonna try really, I'm, you know, I, sometimes I just can't remember that far.	Chief Complaint
Just the best you can.	Chief Complaint
It's kinda like third grade? Okay.	Chief Complaint
Oh, no.	Chief Complaint
It was like, yeah, it was like third grade.	Chief Complaint
I beat up my sister.	Chief Complaint
Older, younger sister? Older.	Chief Complaint
Okay.	Others
Okay.	Others
You beat her up? Cause she tried to beat me up.	Chief Complaint
So, I jumped on her so many times.	Chief Complaint
I felt really bad, though.	Chief Complaint
Like I cried for days in my sleep, you know, cause I felt really bad.	Chief Complaint
I keep apologizing to her and apologizing, you know, come up to me, you know, few months later and, I'm so sorry about what happened that one time.	Chief Complaint
She was like No, it's okay.	Chief Complaint
You know, we'd just go off and like, You know, that was dumb, but it's okay.	Chief Complaint
Yeah, yeah.	Chief Complaint
So that's an example of pretty early? Yeah, uhm, that I can remember.	Chief Complaint
But, you know, even if I had more time, I'd probably,	Chief Complaint
Go back to even before? Yeah.	Chief Complaint
Even before.	Chief Complaint
Oh, wait.	Chief Complaint
Once, when I was four, my brother and sister used to play, keep away from Megan, and they'd run away from me and jump fences.	Chief Complaint
I was four years old.	Chief Complaint
I couldn't, you know.	Chief Complaint
They were both older than you? Yeah.	Chief Complaint
I'm the youngest.	Chief Complaint
I couldn't chase after them.	Chief Complaint
I couldn't jump a fence.	Chief Complaint
I was four and it made me angry, you know, that one and the other one that I could think of.	Chief Complaint
You know, when you say that second one, uhm, you sounded sad.	Chief Complaint
Yeah, it made me sad, too.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
I think more angry.	Chief Complaint
Sure.	Chief Complaint
Uh-huh.	Chief Complaint
I was really young, though.	Chief Complaint
One of, you know, when it comes to my mind that I was very angry, cause it personally just because.	Chief Complaint
You're a third grader? Yeah.	Client Details
I'm in third grade.	Client Details
Your sister was trying to beat you up? She was trying to like, uhm, embarrass me, you know? And make me look like I was nothing cause she had older friends. Uh hmm.	Chief Complaint
or something like that.	Chief Complaint
Uh hmm.	Chief Complaint
Like make me look stupid in front of my friends.	Chief Complaint
Okay.	Chief Complaint
So it made me very.	Chief Complaint
Okay.	Chief Complaint
And I chased her around.	Chief Complaint
Okay.	Chief Complaint
you know, the schoolyard and cornered her and started jumping on her stomach.	Chief Complaint
There was like, Ha, ha, ha, they'll go on, like cheering me on and doing and sat at the corner of the school and, yeah, I got in trouble.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
Yeah, I still think about that.	Chief Complaint
And so, so first, the other one, when you were four kinda make you sad and mad? Yeah.	Chief Complaint
And the second one, uhm, sounds like you're maybe embarrassed in that.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
I was embarrassed of what I did.	Chief Complaint
Uh hmm.	Chief Complaint
That's the word, yeah.	Chief Complaint
That's exactly how I felt because I didn't, you know, want people to think, you know, that's me and my sister, so I kind of do.	Chief Complaint
But you were embarrassed though she tried to embarrass you.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
was what I was saying, so embarrassed and then mad and then embarrassed.	Chief Complaint
And then embarrassed that I did it.	Chief Complaint
Right.	Chief Complaint
So it's feeling two, you know, types of, you know, embarrassment.	Chief Complaint
Embarrassed now on both ends.	Chief Complaint
yeah.	Chief Complaint
of the mad.	Chief Complaint
Uh hmm.	Chief Complaint
Okay.	Chief Complaint
I didn't love her very well.	Chief Complaint
# AS T2
So, I don't know you, you don't know me.	Others
Basically, we're kind of strangers.	Others
So, uhm, I, you know, I have different ways of trying to get to know people.	Others
One is just to ask you some things about what you like and what you don't like.	Others
All right.	Others
Okay? So I, I'll just do that if that's okay.	Others
All right.	Others
No worries.	Others
Okay.	Client Details
So, I'm gonna sometimes write things down, uhm, not always, but write a few things down.	Client Details
So, tell me, uhm, what's your favorite thing to do, favorite recreational activity? Uhm, there is a couple of things.	Client Details
I like playing football.	Client Details
Yeah.	Client Details
Like playing basketball.	Client Details
Okay.	Client Details
Uhm, I like to draw and write music.	Client Details
Yeah.	Client Details
Write music, not lyrics.	Client Details
Uhm, lyrics.	Client Details
Or both.	Client Details
Oh, write, write lyrics, okay.	Client Details
And that's about it.	Client Details
Yeah.	Client Details
So those are the things you really like.	Client Details
Uh hmm.	Client Details
Enjoy a lot.	Others
How about some things you hate? Sometimes you can tell a lot about somebody by finding out things that just make you.	Others
The same things.	Others
You hate football, you hate basketball, and you hate drawing? Ah, I, I, these are my favorite, these are my favorite things to do but they make me mad.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
Cause I get frustrated when I, like when I play basketball, if I don't play so well it'll make me mad.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
If I don't, you know, I like QB when I play football.	Chief Complaint
If I don't get a good pass or somebody drops it, I get mad.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
Uhm, when I draw, if I can't think enough in the drawing and I mess up, I get mad.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
Or, uhm, when I write music, if I can't think of anything and I get writer's block I get really mad.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Client Details
So, yeah.	Client Details
And they're, they're like my worst things to do.	Client Details
Like, when somebody wouldn't want me to do, but they're my favorite things to do so I do them anyways.	Client Details
Uh-huh, that's interesting.	Chief Complaint
So, I can tell you what the issues are already.	Chief Complaint
All right.	Chief Complaint
You're ready? Yeah.	Others
So, you know what the problem is about the, about anger for you? Hmm.	Others
You're a perfectionist.	Chief Complaint
I try to be.	Chief Complaint
I don't really mean to be, though.	Chief Complaint
I don't like to be.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
because if I don't play as good as I wanna play in basketball, for example, for missing a shot when I know I can make it, I know I should make it, it makes me mad.	Chief Complaint
I mean, really mad.	Chief Complaint
Right.	Chief Complaint
I mean, I would just be like, all right, don't worry, you know, I'm, I'm really mad now.	Chief Complaint
It's like I flip out.	Chief Complaint
You think you should do things right all the time.	Chief Complaint
Yeah, uh-huh.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
That's tough.	Chief Complaint
Man, you got a huge burden.	Chief Complaint
I don't, I don't mean to.	Chief Complaint
Didn't mean to.	Chief Complaint
That's a lot of pressure.	Chief Complaint
trying to, it's, it's it's a lot of stress cause, you know, this is kinda the way that I was brought up. You know, I never wanted to lose at anything.	Chief Complaint
I never wanted to be less of, less than anybody.	Chief Complaint
I've always wanted to be the best but.	Chief Complaint
Uh hmm.	Chief Complaint
I've never done that yet.	Chief Complaint
When you say the way you were brought up, what kinds of things did you learn growing up? Uhm, that, you know, if I didn't do good or were not, that I would get picked on for it.	Chief Complaint
Uh hmm.	Chief Complaint
Or beat on for it by, by peers, by you know, classmates or whatever.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
Not by parents.	Chief Complaint
No.	Chief Complaint
Never.	Chief Complaint
But I've, you know it just kind of from elementary school cause if I didn't do anything right I always get picked on or beat up for it.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
Or, you know, I, I used to dress like dorky.	Chief Complaint
I never liked, cause I used to dress like a dork wearing tight jeans and everything when I was little that like I get beat up everyday so I finally realized maybe I'll wear some baggy clothes, you know, maybe they'll stop beating me up.	Chief Complaint
They didn't stop beating me up but didn't beat me up as bad.	Chief Complaint
So, it worked a little bit.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
I mean, maybe they still beat me up everyday but maybe every other day like, draw me like one every time.	Chief Complaint
Then I, before I talk funny too.	Chief Complaint
I, I talk different than they did.	Chief Complaint
Yeah? They beat me up for that, so.	Chief Complaint
And so, you got picked on a lot.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
That's got a lot to do with my anger.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Others
Why? Yeah, why? Cause I was small and they could.	Chief Complaint
So it starts off.	Chief Complaint
It's kinda weird.	Chief Complaint
It starts off with you picking on yourself.	Chief Complaint
It's like, well, wait a minute, uhm, Shawn, everybody misses.	Chief Complaint
You know that.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
It is this kind of a, it's different in a way, it's like I don't want them, I don't wanna miss ever.	Chief Complaint
And I wanna be the best player always no matter who I'm playing with.	Chief Complaint
And I don't like to get beaten.	Chief Complaint
I don't like to do anything is wrong.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
Cause if I do it then, it just shows that I'm, I'm weak.	Chief Complaint
Okay, so the last time you played basketball, on a scale of 0 to 100, what percent of competence, of skill would you give yourself? Uhm, I think I'll be estimating a little bit, uhm.	Chief Complaint
A 100 percent would be a perfect day.	Chief Complaint
not nope.	Chief Complaint
Okay.	Others
Huh.	Others
Zero would be a total flunk, right? Well, I play about, 50 percent.	Chief Complaint
You give yourself 50 percent? Okay.	Chief Complaint
So, 50 percent and, uhm, okay, hmm, have you ever gotten a 100? Couple of times.	Chief Complaint
So you have a couple of 100s.	Chief Complaint
Okay.	Chief Complaint
When you get a 100 percent, now we're going to use a grade, we're using a grading system, okay? Would you give yourself an A? Uhm, for totally overall like ah, every year? No, just one, the one time, the one or the two times when you've played and you think you did a 100 percent perfect.	Chief Complaint
Would you give yourself an A? No.	Chief Complaint
You wouldn't give yourself an A? No.	Chief Complaint
Why not? A 100 percent.	Chief Complaint
You couldn't do any better.	Chief Complaint
Ah, I could do better.	Chief Complaint
I could always do better.	Chief Complaint
No.	Chief Complaint
So you would never give yourself a 100 percent? Uhm, no, I'd give myself a 100 but then, you know, I, you can grade higher than a 100 percent.	Chief Complaint
But you wouldn't give yourself an A? Uh umm.	Chief Complaint
Oh.	Chief Complaint
Just because I, I wouldn't give anybody 100 percent, anybody except for a couple of people in the NBA an A if you were grading them ability.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
Just because it's, it's so hard or now, you can make every shot, but you can't play your best.	Chief Complaint
Your best is, you know, never getting touched, never getting the ball stolen, never getting stopped, you know, dunking and everything.	Chief Complaint
That means you got to be able to do it all perfectly.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
Have you done it? I mean a 100, no, I can just rim but I can't dunk.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
Uhm, you know what I mean but you, it's, you gotta be out gets passed and be perfect, without making a single mistake.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
Ain't nobody do that.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
And that's more than a 100 percent.	Chief Complaint
Nobody could do that.	Chief Complaint
No, that's, some people can, I mean, but it's like, you can't, it's, I don't know, it's hard.	Chief Complaint
So, that's a lot of pressure to never ever be able to really think that you got an A, playing basketball or football, probably.	Chief Complaint
I mean, your drawing, it's similar, it's, it's never quite perfect.	Chief Complaint
No.	Chief Complaint
I wish it was.	Chief Complaint
Yeah, well, well, my, one of my goals here is to help you deal with anger, right? I think the anger's about your perfectionism and that you can just never do well enough and so you're pissed off.	Chief Complaint
Now, I'm not quite sure why you're so perfectionistic, why it matters so much to you.	Chief Complaint
But that in your mind, I think, is, is kind of what is so, it becomes so important to be perfect that when you're not, you're pissed at yourself and take it out at other people.	Chief Complaint
You with me? Yeah.	Chief Complaint
So, so I'm thinking it's the perfectionism, but now I'm just kinda, I'm trying to think that maybe, maybe you could pretend that you're the counselor, okay? And I'm coming in to see you.	Chief Complaint
And I'm a perfectionist.	Chief Complaint
I'm never happy with my performance.	Chief Complaint
I get pissed.	Chief Complaint
You're in Dorm 1 so you didn't hear when my wife told the story about me playing basketball.	Chief Complaint
I think she told that to too.	Chief Complaint
And that things weren't going well, and so, uhm, I kicked the ball across the gym and the ref, of course.	Chief Complaint
Of course, I, I did that after I told the ref that I thought maybe he was doing some things wrong.	Chief Complaint
Then I kicked the ball across the gym and, ah, then he kicked me out of the gym.	Chief Complaint
He'd already kicked me out of the game, then out of the gym, and, uhm, so the ball was actually mine so I took it and left.	Chief Complaint
It was terribly embarrassing.	Chief Complaint
It was a terrible story, okay? So, I need your help.	Chief Complaint
I need your help because when things don't go right, when I don't score 30, when I don't do things perfectly, I go berserk.	Chief Complaint
How can you help me with this perfectionism problem? I don't know.	Chief Complaint
Patient: Why do you get, why do you get, why do you get mad? I get mad because I could do better.	Chief Complaint
I know I could do better.	Chief Complaint
It's bullshit for me to play the way I play.	Chief Complaint
I can do better.	Chief Complaint
I should win every game.	Chief Complaint
Let me think for a second, I'm not a psychologist.	Chief Complaint
Yes, that's fine.	Chief Complaint
Being a psychologist, you think, you got to think.	Chief Complaint
Uhm.	Chief Complaint
Hmm.	Chief Complaint
Okay well, I couldn't say that, you know, don't think about it, don't think that it's just a game.	Chief Complaint
But it's also hard, it's hard to think like that.	Chief Complaint
So, you would tell me just think it's a, just think it's just a game? Yeah.	Chief Complaint
The, the you know it's just a game.	Chief Complaint
You know there's no reason to get mad because not everybody is perfect.	Chief Complaint
Okay.	Chief Complaint
But, you know, you probably, is, but, you know, if you were me, you know,	Chief Complaint
No, that's okay, you can go on with your sentence.	Chief Complaint
So you're telling me, you're telling me that I need to think different.	Chief Complaint
Is that what you're telling me? Well, not think different, but like, uhm, oh, I'm trying to think about how to say this.	Chief Complaint
Think outside being perfect.	Chief Complaint
Not being different, you know, think the same, but think, think as if that, you know, it doesn't matter.	Chief Complaint
So I need to practice thinking that it doesn't matter? Yeah.	Chief Complaint
But it does.	Chief Complaint
Right.	Chief Complaint
It matters to me, so I need to practice thinking different, cause it matters to me now.	Chief Complaint
And I think about how much it matters.	Chief Complaint
So what you're saying is that I need to think about it, it doesn't matter.	Chief Complaint
Let it go.	Chief Complaint
Yeah, but it doesn't matter.	Chief Complaint
To me.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
So, but your point is Change that way of thinking, John, and you'll feel better.	Chief Complaint
Is that what you're saying? Uhm, yeah.	Chief Complaint
Okay, okay.	Chief Complaint
No, that's,	Chief Complaint
What if I can't? it's, ah, it's hard.	Chief Complaint
It's hard.	Chief Complaint
So, No.	Chief Complaint
how do I do it? How do I, how do I change the way I'm thinking? play.	Chief Complaint
Okay.	Others
Uhm.	Others
Okay, I'll try.	Chief Complaint
Then I'll fail, and then I'll be even more pissed.	Chief Complaint
Oh.	Chief Complaint
cause now my psychologist told me to play better.	Chief Complaint
Uhm.	Chief Complaint
That was a joke.	Chief Complaint
Oh, I know it.	Chief Complaint
It's okay.	Chief Complaint
Well, you know, what I'm trying to do, you can do what I'm trying to do.	Chief Complaint
Don't play for a little while, you know, I mean, when I play, like, I'll stop playing.	Chief Complaint
When I play again I'm always a little better. But then you can try not playing.	Chief Complaint
Take some time off.	Chief Complaint
Take, or, you know, get some new hobby.	Chief Complaint
Some non-competitive hobbies.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
Well, drawing and writing music, ah, ah, you know, Yeah, but.	Chief Complaint
that's not competitive.	Chief Complaint
Well, then.	Chief Complaint
I still get pissed about that.	Chief Complaint
Oh, well.	Chief Complaint
Quit smoking.	Chief Complaint
Maybe that'll help.	Chief Complaint
You think smoking, you think smoking is making me more uptight? Maybe.	Chief Complaint
It's could be.	Chief Complaint
Nicotine can do that.	Chief Complaint
Yeah, yeah.	Chief Complaint
It does.	Chief Complaint
Uhm.	Chief Complaint
It's a stimulant.	Chief Complaint
Oh, great.	Chief Complaint
Uhm.	Chief Complaint
Do you smoke? Yeah.	Chief Complaint
Uhm.	Chief Complaint
But you should quit, right? Yeah.	Chief Complaint
Because if you were perfect, you could quit.	Chief Complaint
I'm working on it.	Chief Complaint
It's hard to quit.	Chief Complaint
I'm not mad at that cause.	Chief Complaint
It's hard.	Chief Complaint
That, that's really hard especially it's almost still smoke everyday.	Chief Complaint
Couldn't have your basketball any? No.	Chief Complaint
But I have been smoking and playing for so long that it doesn't.	Chief Complaint
It doesn't? To me, it doesn't affect me.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
I mean, I, I know I could play so much better and run so much faster, and jump so much higher because I now have the, ah, more stamina, and I wouldn't get tired so easy if I quit.	Chief Complaint
It's just so hard to quit smoking.	Chief Complaint
It's a drug.	Chief Complaint
I hate it, but I like, but I hate.	Chief Complaint
Yeah, it's, uhm.	Chief Complaint
So, let me ask you this, though, I may be the psychologist again.	Chief Complaint
Thank you.	Chief Complaint
You did a good job.	Chief Complaint
Not really.	Chief Complaint
Oh, come on.	Chief Complaint
You, you've never been a psychologist before.	Chief Complaint
No, but.	Chief Complaint
You came up with one good idea.	Chief Complaint
What was that? Change the way I'm thinking.	Chief Complaint
Yeah, but it's hard to change the way you think, it's so hard cause it's stuck there.	Chief Complaint
But you know, you were, you, you're absolutely right on in terms of what's one of the main ways that psychologist teach people to not be so pissed off, is to change the way they're thinking.	Chief Complaint
Uh hmm but that.	Chief Complaint
And that it's really hard.	Chief Complaint
And it really takes time.	Chief Complaint
It takes time.	Chief Complaint
And I've been, I've been working on it for two and a half years.	Chief Complaint
Right.	Chief Complaint
Try to calm myself down and calm my anger down.	Chief Complaint
Uh hmm.	Chief Complaint
And, you, know, I'm getting there, yeah, but it has, ah, taking a lot of time for it to do that.	Chief Complaint
Right.	Social History
cause when I first, when I first moved to Montana with my mom, I was at this bar and playing a pool.	Social History
I was listening to some music, some rap.	Social History
Yeah.	Social History
And this guy made a really racist comment.	Social History
I didn't appreciate it when I told him to.	Social History
Uh hmm.	Social History
And his friend got up and I his friend, too.	Social History
And, you know, they sat down and my mom turned her back to the back cause she was, you know, I'm half-Black.	Social History
So, I didn't appreciate it at all.	Social History
Yeah.	Social History
Especially if they're coming from where I'm from, you know, from a little, you know, hate town like that.	Social History
And, you know, I'm, well, I'm not used to it.	Social History
And I don't like people making racist comments.	Social History
And mom took me to the back and tried, you know, telling me that, you know these guys are different than, this is a different place from where you grew up.	Social History
I said, I don't care.	Social History
You know, you don't say something like that and expect me not to do nothing back because that offends me and that should offend you, too, cause I'm your son.	Social History
Uh hmm.	Social History
Then she kind of, then she kind of, you know, realize that it was kind of not.	Social History
And she said, well, just calm down you can't talk about I was like, ah, whatever.	Social History
So, that's why, you know, I didn't talk to that guy.	Social History
Uh hmm.	Chief Complaint
And, you know, from then to now, I'll calm down a lot.	Chief Complaint
I don't get mad at just, you know, at the same things I used to.	Chief Complaint
Ah, I do, but I don't flip out as bad as I did.	Chief Complaint
Uh hmm.	Chief Complaint
Uh hmm.	Chief Complaint
Sometimes I do, but sometimes I don't.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
And it just takes a lot of time.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Others
for me to.	Others
Work on it.	Chief Complaint
# AS T3
So, it's okay if I call you Michael? Yeah, it's okay.	Client Details
Okay.	Others
Good.	Others
Uhm, you know, we know each other a little bit.	Others
Uh hmm.	Others
But not a lot and, uhm, this is your time, you can talk about whatever you want.	Others
Uh hmm.	Others
If there's some ways that, uhm, I can be helpful to you here, in the future, ah, I'd like to be.	Chief Complaint
but one thing that came to mind for me, and I thought maybe we'd start with this is that, uhm, you know, I'm not, ah, I was never in gang, okay? I'm not African-American, okay? I don't know kinda, I can try to relate to where you've been and things you've experienced, but I don't know much about it and so I don't know if you'd feel comfortable telling me some stuff.	Chief Complaint
All right, I'll start with anything.	Chief Complaint
What? I start it.	Others
Yeah.	Others
Yeah.	Others
So, what kind of stuff are you gone through, the kind of things that you've experienced.	Chief Complaint
Oh, where do I start, whew, well, first of all, when I, when I first joined the gang, you know, things then, you know, just all of a sudden, it just got wild.	Chief Complaint
Uh hmm.	Chief Complaint
It kinda took a while.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
About months went past, whatever, uhm, but one, you know, at that time did come, I was, getting jumped and getting stabbed and shot.	Chief Complaint
You were kind of drifting that way? War-gang stuff? Not really that.	Social History
It's just that, you know, being an out-of-towner, you know, nobody really noticed you, and people, you know, well, when I'm I used to just, you know, look familiar, and you weren't welcome basically.	Social History
Okay, so you're kind of ah, a new guy? Yeah.	Client Details
And they, so they used you as a target? Yeah.	Client Details
Not so much as the target but, you know, as much as my parents, you know, and.	Client Details
Okay.	Client Details
go from the hair to the clothes, shoes, you know, kind of stereotyped me before I've even gotten to the gang life.	Client Details
Okay.	Chief Complaint
So you dressed in town and look in town like maybe you're in a gang.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
And soon you got treated like that.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
Okay.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
So then, you got in and you said that you were, uhm, I thought you said you were a Crips, is that it? Yeah.	Chief Complaint
No.	Others
What? Yeah.	Others
Okay.	Family History
You didn't know which one? You're wearing red, I should have known.	Family History
So, how did that happen? How do you pick? What's the.	Family History
Uhm, it wasn't, it's not really, it wasn't really hard for me because, you know, my mom's side of family, there's, there's the Crip gangs stuff.	Family History
Uh hmm.	Family History
Lots of my family is, it's what they do.	Family History
On my dad's side of the family, well, Latin gang called Latin Kings,	Family History
Uh hmm.	Chief Complaint
you know, they're not really, they're not Crips or Bloods, they're just a gang.	Chief Complaint
Pretty thing.	Chief Complaint
Right.	Social History
A gang.	Social History
Ah, but, as far as my choosing, I, ah, it was, the neighborhood I lived in it was all Crip neighborhood and walk down the streets to go play basketball or go to school or go to the store some, you know.	Social History
Uh hmm.	Social History
I, matter of fact, I remember the first time that I got beat up for wearing red was when I'm like my second month in Colorado, I had a Miami Heat jersey on and got beat up.	Social History
Uh hmm.	Social History
and then, you know, one day I just decided, well, hey, you know, I got a friend out here, you know, he's, he's in the gang business, you know.	Social History
I'm tired of getting jumped and so, why not? The benefits being.	Social History
Benefits being that the jumping will slow down, you know, it decrease a little bit.	Social History
Uhm, ah, watch their back like they watch mine's, you know.	Social History
Yeah.	Social History
Sort of like a, like my brothers, you know.	Social History
Sure.	Family History
And speaking of my brother, ah, was also, he's also in a gang.	Family History
Yeah.	Family History
Yeah, but different side.	Family History
Right.	Others
Yeah.	Others
Yeah, I think I remember your saying that you and he had gotten into a pretty serious, ah, fight with weapons.	Family History
Yeah.	Family History
But haven't since.	Others
Uh-huh.	Others
That somehow got a truce going? Not so much a truce just, you know, after our, that happened, there is just like, well, you know, it's cool to fight and, you know, Sam, but we're family, ain't gotta kill, you know, Sam, my own brother or his own brother over, you know, some colors, you know, that, when you look at it, or when you really look at it, it really doesn't, you know, mean nothing.	Family History
Uh hmm.	Family History
It'd really be a stupid reason to kill a family member, you know.	Family History
Yeah.	Family History
So, sometimes like you, uhm, step back.	Family History
Somehow, you managed to step back and say, that'd be a stupid reason.	Family History
Nah.	Family History
Actually, there was kind of ah, me swinging it at me and, and dodging it.	Family History
Yeah? Something, yeah.	Others
And then, you guys realized.	Family History
Nah, and then, it kind of fell out of my hands, you know, we just use our hands, feet.	Family History
Okay.	Client Details
And after that, when you decided.	Client Details
Yeah, after that.	Client Details
Let's not use weapons with each other? Nah.	Client Details
It was, it was decision but, you know, it didn't really come out like that.	Client Details
Yeah.	Client Details
It was just, just ceased and then, ah, the other fights were down too, after that incident, there was, just never used weapons.	Client Details
Okay.	Others
I really appreciate you know because I, I'm trying to, try to understand you know.	Others
Yeah.	Others
And so I'll take a guess, and I'm usually wrong, and you just correct me.	Others
I appreciate that.	Others
All right.	Others
No, it wasn't quite like that.	Chief Complaint
It was a little different, so.	Chief Complaint
Uhm, we talked some about, ah, what got you into gang stuff.	Chief Complaint
Uh hmm.	Chief Complaint
And, uhm, and then what kinda got you out of it.	Client Details
Even though you're not totally officially out.	Client Details
Right.	Client Details
But out of active.	Client Details
Ah, yeah, activities.	Client Details
Yeah, out of the activities.	Client Details
Okay.	Client Details
And, and here's what I heard.	Chief Complaint
I heard you say, what kinda got you in was, of course, being where you were, the neighborhood, dressing, a little bit gang street, okay.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
And, I mean, in some ways, you kinda made your recipe for what you're doing now, I guess would be, it seemed like the recipe for getting out of that would be getting out of the neighborhood.	Chief Complaint
Yeah, but then, you know.	Chief Complaint
And changing the way you dress.	Chief Complaint
Oh, that's never gonna change.	Chief Complaint
Okay.	Others
But as far as the.	Others
Some things can change and some things can't.	Chief Complaint
Yeah, as far as the neighborhood go, it is just, it, well, it didn't matter what neighborhood I was gonna live in, it was gonna be there, you know, because you have so many different, ah, types of hoods out there.	Chief Complaint
Right.	Chief Complaint
But as far as, you know, get myself, you know, temporarily away from all that.	Chief Complaint
Uh hmm.	Chief Complaint
It's just the fact of me just getting out of the state, you know, go out to a state where, you know, I could be focused and all that, the way about none of that, you know, that where they don't have gangs out there, you know.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
It's just, yeah, just basically, just getting somewhere where there's no gangs and I could be focused, you know, and don't worry about how much longer I'm gonna live or, and all these other good stuff,	Chief Complaint
Uh hmm.	Chief Complaint
you know.	Chief Complaint
And it's actually pretty different.	Chief Complaint
So, ah, you've made a good pick.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
You think? Yeah.	Chief Complaint
So, I, I just had this funny image coming into my mind and I'm just gonna tell what it was, okay? I just had this, this really funny thought that what if you were dressed like me? You can't even imagine it, can you? No.	Client Details
I just thought to myself, what if we just like switched? Actually, you'd look pretty cool with this on.	Chief Complaint
I would.	Chief Complaint
I would really look good with that.	Chief Complaint
You'd look better.	Chief Complaint
You say, you wouldn't look so good with this.	Chief Complaint
No.	Chief Complaint
Have you ever dressed like this? No.	Client Details
How do you know you wouldn't look cool then? Because that's not my style.	Client Details
Yeah? No.	Client Details
That's not my style.	Client Details
No.	Others
I am, I'm not saying it should be.	Others
Yeah.	Others
I'm just.	Chief Complaint
Yeah, I understand that.	Chief Complaint
But you can, you can understand why I had that thought, though, right? So? cause we dress really different.	Chief Complaint
Oh, yeah.	Chief Complaint
Well.	Others
I see.	Others
Yeah.	Client Details
I thought, well, what if we, ah, I just had this image of you dressed like me.	Client Details
I thought it'd be pretty funny.	Client Details
Yeah.	Client Details
So, here's what I, here's what I've learned okay? I've learned that you and I, we don't dress alike, okay.	Client Details
You've got a different style.	Client Details
I love the word you said, style.	Client Details
You have a different style.	Client Details
Uhm, and I might learn from that, maybe.	Client Details
Okay? Yeah.	Client Details
I think in some way that we think alike.	Client Details
Okay? And that you, actually, and I can understand each other more kinda on that thinking level, even though we're a lot different.	Client Details
And one of the things I, I just learned about you was that, is that, you're a really good thinker.	Client Details
I mean, you can kinda think your way through things if you're calm and cool.	Client Details
Yeah.	Client Details
Okay.	Client Details
And so, what my message to you would be the last thing and the main thing would be, you got too good a brain.	Chief Complaint
Your brain is too good to not use it.	Chief Complaint
You know.	Chief Complaint
So you oughta use it as much as you can, whenever you can, cause it's just too good to waste.	Chief Complaint
So, let's just do a couple of minutes to what we call a debriefing.	Chief Complaint
Okay, that's just when you tell me, what, what're you gonna remember of our time together? What was helpful? What did I say or do that was not so helpful? Uhm.	Chief Complaint
What I learned from our first little session was, you know, that, first, ah, you don't take mistake I. You don't take, you know, stupid shit so, so hard, you know.	Chief Complaint
Uh hmm.	Chief Complaint
I don't stoop to nobody else's level, you know, don't, you know, just basically think before I do everything, you know.	Chief Complaint
And before I say something, uhm, have more confidence in myself which I could believe I can do, uhm.	Chief Complaint
Yeah, we got to be.	Others
Yeah.	Others
Okay.	Chief Complaint
Anything that was less helpful or you didn't mind at all? Or you wished you haven't learned? No.	Chief Complaint
Never believe you're stupid.	Chief Complaint
Okay.	Chief Complaint
I'm just, I'm just telling you that.	Chief Complaint
I'm a psychologist.	Chief Complaint
I'm the boss.	Chief Complaint
There are a lot of things I don't know, but one thing I do know is you're not stupid.	Chief Complaint
Thank you.	Chief Complaint
Yeah, you're welcome.	Others
# AS T4
Yep.	Others
Oh, man.	Others
Surreal.	Others
Quite a week? Yeah.	Client Details
It was something.	Client Details
How are you? I'm okay, I think.	Chief Complaint
I don't know.	Chief Complaint
I'm kind of not sure.	Chief Complaint
I feel okay today.	Chief Complaint
I don't know.	Chief Complaint
I think I'm definitely kind of mildly depressed or something.	Chief Complaint
I feel tired.	Chief Complaint
I was just a crazy.	Chief Complaint
I was already feeling a little off before all of this shit happened so.	Chief Complaint
What was it like for you Friday? It was crazy.	Chief Complaint
It was definitely traumatizing, there's no question.	Chief Complaint
Oh, my goodness.	Chief Complaint
This was at night, you mean? This was Thursday after they killed that cop and got chased into Cheshire.	Chief Complaint
I don't know.	Chief Complaint
It's going to take some time.	Chief Complaint
And then what was it 20 hours? I don't know.	Chief Complaint
It's hard to put into words that kind of terror because at that point you're like, Well, this guy has nothing.	Chief Complaint
Obviously he knows it's over.	Chief Complaint
They didn't care about dying or killing other people so it would make sense.	Chief Complaint
If I was that person and that insane, then it would only make sense to just knock someone's door down, take a few more people out, and just blow yourself up.	Chief Complaint
There are no words to explain, to feel like that could happen.	Chief Complaint
I mean yeah, they were armed, but all that takes is a second.	Chief Complaint
If he knows he's going to die anyway, just do it.	Chief Complaint
It was a fucking it was just you know.	Chief Complaint
I don't know.	Chief Complaint
From the starting point of hearing the noises and then seeing them, I would think that alone is.	Chief Complaint
Oh, yeah.	Chief Complaint
Just like the sounds were so loud.	Chief Complaint
It was clearly.	Chief Complaint
there was no confusing.	Chief Complaint
I mean it was surreal.	Chief Complaint
It was surreal.	Chief Complaint
Suddenly it sounded like there was a war going on.	Chief Complaint
The horrifying part, the first thing I thought because it sounded like so much noise, it didn't sound like two or three people, I was horrified that they'd come to Cheshire and there was some kind of group, do you know what I mean? And that there were suddenly 30 insane people waiting fully armed for I don't know what.	Chief Complaint
That was horrifying.	Chief Complaint
Horrifying.	Chief Complaint
Because you don't know what's happening at that point at all.	Chief Complaint
No idea.	Chief Complaint
No idea.	Chief Complaint
How many there are. Had you been asleep? No.	Chief Complaint
I was wide awake.	Chief Complaint
I had just walked down that way that night.	Chief Complaint
It was a nice night.	Chief Complaint
Since I already wasn't feeling that great that week I was like, You know, I'm just going to take a walk.	Chief Complaint
I walked right where it all went down like around 11:00.	Chief Complaint
And then I got home and I was talking to my friend in Phoenix, so we were talking.	Chief Complaint
I had the window kind of open and I saw all of these cops flying down the street and I thought That's weird.	Chief Complaint
The cops were going really fast.	Chief Complaint
I was like, Yeah, this is not normal.	Chief Complaint
Then by the time I told Giorgio, I heard two loud noise and then I hung up.	Chief Complaint
You went down to get your mom? Yeah.	Chief Complaint
I grabbed Cecelia.	Chief Complaint
I grabbed my shoes.	Chief Complaint
My mom was already awake.	Chief Complaint
I was like, We're going right now.	Chief Complaint
We're getting in the car and we're going.	Chief Complaint
But then, for whatever reason, I thought to call 911 and, when I told them my address and stuff, they were like, Just turn off all the lights and don't go near the windows.	Chief Complaint
Definitely do not leave your house.	Chief Complaint
Lock all the doors.	Chief Complaint
It was crazy.	Chief Complaint
On the other hand, once it was over I also felt a tremendous amount of I mean, I've never been prouder to be from Cheshire.	Chief Complaint
Between the cooperation of citizens and law enforcement, that's fucking amazing.	Chief Complaint
We're going to get the 911 guys.	Chief Complaint
just fucking hunted them down like dogs.	Chief Complaint
It's kind of weird.	Chief Complaint
I don't know, when I think it, it felt like a police state.	Chief Complaint
It was a police state.	Chief Complaint
That was kind of weird.	Chief Complaint
I don't know how you get around that if this is the world we're going to live in.	Chief Complaint
You're going to have to give up some civil liberties.	Chief Complaint
So when it was all over it did feel good.	Chief Complaint
I went out with people thanking cops and that felt pretty amazing.	Chief Complaint
They were doing all these sweeps.	Chief Complaint
They came to our house several times.	Chief Complaint
One of the times on Friday before they'd caught this guy, the police on the block knocked on the door and went down and it was actually very moving because when I opened the door, suddenly they became very human.	Chief Complaint
They were like, Hey, we're just doing a check door to door.	Chief Complaint
We just want to see how everyone is doing.	Chief Complaint
Are you guys doing okay? That was very moving, actually.	Chief Complaint
But then it's depressing because I know this is going to happen again.	Chief Complaint
I'm surprised it doesn't happen more often.	Chief Complaint
That's just very depressing.	Chief Complaint
It's a big country and there are a lot of people, just random, just freaks.	Chief Complaint
Overall I guess I'm okay.	Chief Complaint
I just feel tired.	Chief Complaint
I definitely feel kind of depressed.	Chief Complaint
I don't feel very motivated.	Chief Complaint
I've been feeling a little bit sick to my stomach.	Chief Complaint
I was telling my mom everything would be okay, but in my mind I was like, Well, what are the chances of him coming to our house? They could have.	Chief Complaint
Yeah, but then I was like, What are the chances that any of this is happening? It is happening in my backyard in all of our backyards in that neighborhood so for any one of is it very well could.	Chief Complaint
It's not like we don't know where they are at all, but then it's like what are the chances they're going to end up at my house? But when literally there's a major event, cluster fuck, clearly it could happen. It's here.	Chief Complaint
He's going to end up in someone's yard or house.	Chief Complaint
Exactly.	Chief Complaint
Exactly.	Chief Complaint
It's very, very scary.	Chief Complaint
I thought of you even with the police knocking on people's doors.	Chief Complaint
I mean I know they're there for good reason and they're there to help and protect, but just police alone have been a form of trauma.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
This time with that, I didn't feel that this time.	Chief Complaint
I felt good that they were around but I just can't put it into words.	Chief Complaint
It was surreal.	Chief Complaint
It was beyond or suddenly there would be a commotion at one of the houses around us where they'd be surrounding the house yelling, telling people to come out bizarre.	Chief Complaint
I don't know why in those houses.	Chief Complaint
Usually the people that would come out are some white, old ladies.	Chief Complaint
That just drives home that he could be hiding anywhere here.	Chief Complaint
Even that though.	Chief Complaint
It's not just that he could come to your house, you're watching this happen.	Chief Complaint
He could be right there.	Chief Complaint
Right.	Chief Complaint
Right.	Chief Complaint
And really where he ended up is.	Chief Complaint
Not far, right? Yeah.	Chief Complaint
It's weird.	Chief Complaint
It has only accentuated how I was already feeling, so now everything feels really weird and discombobulated.	Chief Complaint
It's just strange going back to our routines.	Chief Complaint
I guess all in all I'm doing okay but.	Chief Complaint
Yesterday I was like, Wow, do I need to see Dr. Carlton again maybe? Do I have some kind of low-grade depression going on? because even before all of this happened I wasn't feeling awful, but I just I'm just so tired.	Chief Complaint
Before all this happened you had been in a space for a week or week and a half where it was like coming down off of the flow of tremendous energy about the two sites connecting.	Chief Complaint
You've been pushing and pushing and working and actually been productive and staying up late.	Chief Complaint
You had your hand in so many things moving forward.	Chief Complaint
How could you keep that pace up forever? Impossible.	Chief Complaint
And you got sick a little bit.	Chief Complaint
you got tired just letting your body decompress.	Chief Complaint
And then as you're decompressing you're aware that there's just a lot of other stuff there feelings about relationships.	Chief Complaint
We were talking about Kelly and Bethany.	Chief Complaint
Going back and forth and just feeling really confused, I think, about what you feel and what happens the closer you get to somebody that makes you then sort of look elsewhere.	Chief Complaint
You think a lot of confusion as new things were getting opened up for the first time and then this happens.	Chief Complaint
I could see in that state that this just added fuel to the fire, being totally turned upside down and inside out for a while.	Chief Complaint
Yeah, it's funny, because last night Kelly came over and we just hung out at home.	Chief Complaint
It was really nice, but I don't know what it is, I just It's like there's a part of me that just wants to retreat and just wants to be alone.	Chief Complaint
I just don't know.	Chief Complaint
Maybe your metaphor about being let out of prison and, again, the coincidence of this event happening right now as you're really getting into this process and, I think, more opening up about what happens when you're really known to another person, whether it's me, whether it's Kelly as the relationship grows deeper.	Chief Complaint
And you're actually being your whole self and not just editing and picking and choosing what to say and who to be.	Chief Complaint
She's being her whole self, but this event, in a way, is filling you with a massive amount of terror.	Chief Complaint
Again, that's something else in a way, but that's what's there lurking right now.	Chief Complaint
Is this going to be terrifying? Will I get hurt if I get close to her? the way I think you have been in the past in your childhood.	Chief Complaint
Or will I hurt her.	Chief Complaint
Will you hurt her? Right.	Chief Complaint
Are you the terrorist? Are you going to get terrified? Because right now there's something in me that feels a little bit reckless, like flirting with other girls.	Chief Complaint
There's something in me that's whatever.	Chief Complaint
I think there's so much of your life because of your relationship with your mother that has given you those two options.	Chief Complaint
Either you get hurt or you hurt someone else and if that's the choice, hurting someone else is in some ways preferable to getting hurt.	Chief Complaint
But it's like there's nothing else in the middle of those two.	Chief Complaint
Yeah, I don't know.	Chief Complaint
I just feel drained.	Chief Complaint
My appetite is back, but I just feel off.	Chief Complaint
I also get the feeling that there's a lot of feeling.	Chief Complaint
You know you say sometimes you hit these moments where you're watching something and all this feeling comes out, like a release almost, and then you feel better.	Chief Complaint
It has that feeling to me, like there's something dammed up inside.	Chief Complaint
Probably.	Chief Complaint
Even just from what you went through Friday.	Chief Complaint
Well I did have one of those moments Friday when they came and they said, How are you doing.	Chief Complaint
When I locked the door, that was the one time I just completely broke down. Good.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
No, it was good.	Chief Complaint
Or I think there was another time when I was petting Cecelia or something.	Chief Complaint
Both times it's feeling a kind of being cared for.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
Throughout this whole thing I did have moments like that where I cried.	Chief Complaint
There will always be more good people.	Chief Complaint
I'm so proud to be from here.	Chief Complaint
I don't know of any hate crimes so far or just, in general, people opening their homes or giving people rides or whatever it might be.	Chief Complaint
It's amazing.	Chief Complaint
Even the law enforcement.	Chief Complaint
As much as I don't like cops, in this case, God bless them.	Chief Complaint
Unbelievable.	Chief Complaint
I think the problem, though, is this just highlights and builds up the existential stuff that I feel.	Chief Complaint
It's just all absurd and random.	Chief Complaint
Things happen.	Chief Complaint
It's overwhelming.	Chief Complaint
And yet, you also feel something when you think about the good outweighing the bad.	Chief Complaint
No, definitely.	Chief Complaint
That has an ethic and a meaning to it beyond life is meaningless and we could all die tomorrow.	Chief Complaint
No, no, no.	Chief Complaint
It's not a life is meaningless thing.	Chief Complaint
It's more, I think, just a melancholy-ness.	Chief Complaint
That's exactly it, that it's not meaningless, but that unfair and absurd, senseless things happen and they hurt people and you never know when or where or who it's going to be.	Chief Complaint
Like your dad.	Chief Complaint
Um-hum.	Chief Complaint
And then today is the commemoration of the Assyrian genocide.	Chief Complaint
That's so funny.	Chief Complaint
Normally, to me it's like my dad I just think about it anyway.	Chief Complaint
You don't need one day to commemorate millions of people, but there is something ironic about it happening in Cheshire.	Chief Complaint
It's weird.	Chief Complaint
Friday could bring up your father.	Chief Complaint
Oh, yeah.	Chief Complaint
It brought up lots of things, you know? In a way it just shows that life is short.	Chief Complaint
It's more like trying to beat the clock.	Chief Complaint
This shit that I'm juggling and trying to get done, it's just.	Chief Complaint
Work-wise it makes sense.	Chief Complaint
In relationships, I think it feels more confusing what this kind of threat, loss, conflict.	Chief Complaint
Yeah, in relationships, I don't know.	Chief Complaint
In don't know what to make of it.	Chief Complaint
Kelly and I hung out.	Chief Complaint
Sunday we went to Mystic.	Chief Complaint
When I'm with her it's great, but also I don't know what to make of some of my superficial feelings, like I wish you were skinnier. She's very pretty, but I don't know.	Chief Complaint
There's that.	Chief Complaint
I'm a little confused.	Chief Complaint
I'm just confused.	Chief Complaint
It definitely feels kind of roller-coaster-y now.	Chief Complaint
Do you know what I mean? Like earlier today I was feeling good, and now I feel like shit.	Chief Complaint
And then what happened? Probably coming here, there's just so much.	Chief Complaint
You felt good coming in, though? Yeah.	Chief Complaint
I was walking around.	Chief Complaint
It was beautiful outside.	Chief Complaint
I had a nice walk with Kelly to get coffee.	Chief Complaint
Now I'm sitting here and I feel that tiredness and a little bit of sick in the pit of my stomach, a little headache-y.	Chief Complaint
You feel so sad to me.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
It isn't even an appearance thing.	Chief Complaint
It just feels like there's just the weight of the world on your shoulders right now with this whatever it is this is stirring about your father, like the whole family history of genocide and trauma and torture.	Chief Complaint
There's a lot in this, Brian.	Chief Complaint
It's hard enough just be trying to remember in here in this process and kind of at your own pace getting yourself through it, but a real thing actually just happened in real time that is like these other things.	Chief Complaint
It not only reminds you and brings you back to the feelings of these other experiences, but is another one you are experiencing right now.	Chief Complaint
Like all of the feelings after your father's death that led you to cut yourself off and kind of meander lost into the world out to Oregon, just aimless and disassociated.	Chief Complaint
I can imagine that, hopefully, on a smaller scale and, hopefully, caught that's kind of what we're here to do and help you with but I can imagine that being a piece of what's happening right now.	Chief Complaint
You have enough work under your belt that there's this other life that you have going on that feels like it's yours and you're attending to it, but how could this not be triggering for you of some pretty dramatic feelings? Not to mention where you were before this happened in this process.	Chief Complaint
And the funny thing is that I knew that that was happening even before.	Chief Complaint
Like when the bombings happened, I knew that something felt triggered.	Chief Complaint
It's just like what the fuck? The only two things I keep telling myself is that one, it's not just me.	Chief Complaint
It happened in a whole neighborhood and number two, people died and those families.	Chief Complaint
people are maimed.	Chief Complaint
And number two, at least I have this to come to.	Chief Complaint
Also this is an opportunity to, instead of becoming so disassociated, that's where work can ground you.	Chief Complaint
I just have to find a way to regain some energy.	Chief Complaint
Right now that's what it is.	Chief Complaint
I just feel like I have no energy.	Chief Complaint
I just feel kind of sick.	Chief Complaint
I think when I say of course and no wonder, it's in part just trying to say to the part of you that gets really anxious about where you are today that it would be weird if you weren't here today, given your history.	Chief Complaint
Yeah, yeah.	Chief Complaint
You can go back to Dr. Carlton, but I don't think this is something that we should medicate.	Chief Complaint
This is what you would do if something like this happened.	Chief Complaint
It was starting to happen after Monday and you will come out of this, probably actually sooner than you think.	Chief Complaint
Yeah, yeah.	Chief Complaint
Right, right.	Chief Complaint
I've been reminding myself of that, too.	Chief Complaint
That's what I was saying, I'm actually handling it better than...	Chief Complaint
Totally.	Chief Complaint
I hear you.	Chief Complaint
That's what you're saying, These are the things I keep trying to tell myself.	Chief Complaint
That's part of what you're doing.	Chief Complaint
Yeah, like you said, I'm just kind of waiting to feel those things instead of telling myself those things.	Chief Complaint
Even being interested in what your experience is of this instead of judging it.	Chief Complaint
Right.	Chief Complaint
I'm trying not to be so hard on myself.	Chief Complaint
You were surrounded by judges as a kid.	Family History
So many judgments from your mother and from your mother's whole side of the family.	Family History
Things are either good or bad, good or bad, good or bad not just interest in your experience.	Family History
I think that's why so often you'll move to wanting to judge yourself like, This is bad that this is happening to me.	Family History
And then you say, But the good thing is that I'm doing this.	Family History
It's like things have to be judged as good or as bad and there's something kind of comforting and familiar about knowing whether it gets to go in the good column or it gets to go in the bad column.	Family History
I just think that's what your family did, but it's not about knowing who you are.	Family History
It's not about knowing, it's about categorizing and black-and-white kind of thinking.	Family History
What are you thinking? Nothing specific.	Family History
I was all over the place.	Family History
To where? I don't know.	Chief Complaint
I was thinking on the one hand, what sucks now is I'm full of anxiety, but what is the next thing that's going to happen? Like what's the next bad thing that's going to happen? Today I was like, I could try to write about this, but then, of course, I was thinking, Yeah, well that's what I say about a lot of things and then I don't actually do anything.	Chief Complaint
You were trying to gather it into all of your trauma.	Chief Complaint
Ehh.	Chief Complaint
I'm not doing it.	Chief Complaint
Meaning writing? Or not getting people together? Yeah.	Chief Complaint
No, not really.	Chief Complaint
It's a curse to be so ambitious.	Chief Complaint
It must be nice to just not be as much.	Chief Complaint
I have all of these things on my plate.	Chief Complaint
No one put them there.	Chief Complaint
I'm putting them there, but I can't help it.	Chief Complaint
I think waiting for the next bad thing to happen is trauma.	Chief Complaint
That is a symptom of being traumatized.	Chief Complaint
That's what hyper-vigilance is.	Chief Complaint
It takes many different forms.	Chief Complaint
The expectation that something really bad is going to happen and just waiting for it.	Chief Complaint
It's in some ways an adaptive way of being if you're used to really bad things that keep happening to you.	Chief Complaint
If you're at least prepared for them, that's what it's meant for in a way.	Chief Complaint
But, again, why would you not be waiting for that right now? And why also, for example, would it not freeze you up from leading a regular, humdrum life? That's what happened when you were 20.	Chief Complaint
If horrible, horrible things happen, your whole system starts responding as though you're there for survival and waiting for the next blow.	Chief Complaint
It's not about, then, forward thinking and productivity and planning and being a pro-active person.	Chief Complaint
Reactivity is what's important when you're in trauma for safety, so I could see also this feeling as you look down on yourself that you're not doing it.	Chief Complaint
That's what happens when your brain is preoccupied with staying safe.	Chief Complaint
And your brain became very preoccupied with staying safe as you became really psychosomatic after your father's death.	Chief Complaint
All the fears about, Now me, am I having a heart attack? Am I getting cancer? That's a form of hyper-vigilant waiting for the thing that's going to go wrong in your own body.	Chief Complaint
I think you have that relationally, too.	Chief Complaint
In your relationship with your mother before your father's death.	Chief Complaint
She looks at the picture and says, Oh, she's beautiful.	Chief Complaint
And then, Oh, but she has a big mouth.	Chief Complaint
It's like there it is.	Chief Complaint
There's the bad thing coming in the relationship.	Chief Complaint
There's the dagger that you could be waiting for with Kelly or else be waiting to dole out to Kelly because that feels better.	Chief Complaint
And here am I going to hurt you? Are you going to hurt me? As you've gotten close to people you've gotten hurt one way or another in your early life.	Chief Complaint
You know that comedienne, Margaret Cho? Do you know what I'm talking about? She has a think on salon.com about children and why she's ambivalent and she's pretty sure she doesn't want them.	Chief Complaint
There's one really good part towards the end where she's like, In the end, I think what it is, is that I don't want to love anything that much, and that's something that I know is in me.	Chief Complaint
I don't want to.	Chief Complaint
I was like, Wow, that's such a simple way to say it.	Chief Complaint
I know exactly what she's talking about.	Chief Complaint
There is something perversely freeing in not going there completely.	Chief Complaint
I think she even says something like, not loving something that much, even myself.	Chief Complaint
I was like, Yeah, that makes perfect sense.	Chief Complaint
It makes perfect sense if, when you loved that much, you got hurt.	Chief Complaint
Right.	Chief Complaint
That's very, very sad.	Client Details
Tomorrow.	Client Details
Okay.	Client Details
12:50? All right.	Client Details
Thanks.	Others
See you.	Others
# AS T5
Hi.	Others
I figured you were running late.	Others
I just got back from the restroom.	Client Details
Good.	Client Details
It's chilly out.	Client Details
I didn't get a coffee so if I seem slow and unable to think.	Client Details
I have a closing today.	Client Details
Oh, good.	Client Details
Which I've got to squeeze I've just got another day with all kinds of stuff. It kind of stresses me out to have things all lined up throughout the day.	Client Details
The closing is a quarter to three and then I've got to meet Jess's mom to put the car seat in the car so she can go pick up Lucille.	Client Details
She wants to take Ian so it's not a shocking for Lucille, so they need both car seats.	Client Details
Then I've got to come back and get Ian for Cub Scouts.	Client Details
It's the big pack meeting.	Client Details
I've never been to a pack meeting, so I don't know what we're going to do there.	Client Details
Ian is sleeping over.	Client Details
Are you like a den dad or something or are you just going? No.	Family History
I'm just an adult.	Family History
In the Cub Scouts, you've got to go with your kid.	Family History
You don't just drop them off, which I imagine maybe the older kids just get dropped off.	Family History
I don't know.	Family History
He's going to sleep over.	Family History
Did I tell you how I lost a bedroom? Yes.	Social History
He's going to sleep in my bed tonight.	Social History
He's going to learn to skate tomorrow.	Social History
It goes through March.	Social History
That seems like an awful long time to teach kids to skate.	Social History
I would think at some point they'd give them a stick and a puck and I don't know.	Social History
So I've got to do that tomorrow.	Social History
His Cub Scouts are visiting the fire station at 10:00.	Social History
Neat.	Social History
I really got the winner's share of the farm.	Social History
All the male players on my team are going out Saturday night and Sunday I have the football game.	Social History
What are you going to do with all your free time? Well, hopefully Ian will go to bed early.	Social History
Sunday morning I'll probably end up sleeping late.	Social History
I'll probably be a little hung over.	Social History
The whole thing just makes me anxious.	Social History
I don't know if it's just the closing that's making me anxious or if it's just having all of these things to do.	Social History
I had a week of kind of coming home and just doing titles and working from home.	Social History
I've been going to the office, but going home in the afternoon there are no real pressure or stress on me to get things done.	Social History
Where today I've got I mean I've got plenty of time I've already got documents. I had to order an updated payoff, so I've been waiting on that.	Social History
I went and saw Dr. Micah on Tuesday.	Social History
At first she was cutting back my Wellbutrin, and then at the very end she asked me, Are you depressed? I go, A little bit.	Social History
She was like, Oh, we don't want to go down on the Wellbutrin if you're depressed? so I have to lie to her next time.	Social History
No, I'm not depressed.	Social History
I'm feeling great.	Social History
You want to go down and I guess your concern is making you more anxious? Could you tell her that, that that's more of an issue than your depression? I guess I could.	Chief Complaint
I see her after Thanksgiving.	Chief Complaint
I don't know.	Chief Complaint
It seems to me sort of characteristic that the actual story is a perfectly reasonable story, but you're thinking you'd better tell her a different story because somehow that seems more like it could get you what you want even though the actual story is, like I said, not only pretty reasonable, but would serve you just as well.	Chief Complaint
I'll try it, then.	Chief Complaint
I'm glad you're picking up on these things.	Chief Complaint
Good.	Medical History
I couldn't remember.	Medical History
She said to go up on the Prozac and I can't remember if she told me not to go up on Prozac but I'm going up on it anyways.	Medical History
I'm now taking 25mg of the lamotrigine in the morning.	Medical History
What's that? The lamictal.	Medical History
Less than or more? More.	Medical History
So I'm taking 100 at night and 25 in the morning.	Medical History
I think she's trying to get me on that and the Prozac and that's it, maybe the Klonopin.	Medical History
I don't know.	Medical History
As needed, which is all the time.	Medical History
I don't seem anxious when I go to bed because I fall asleep on the couch and I wake up all discombobulated.	Medical History
Good.	Others
Hunh.	Others
I mean not the discombobulated part, but.	Chief Complaint
But not being anxious.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
And it sounds like it has something to do with having all this stuff to do.	Chief Complaint
I guess my impression is that most of it isn't stuff that, in itself, is hard or worrisome in terms of what it involves.	Chief Complaint
It's more like things have kind of got to go right.	Chief Complaint
You're not going to have a lot of time to be worried or be down or be distracted, so maybe you're kind of worried of what will happen if you're feeling one of those ways.	Chief Complaint
Or just if there is some hiccup somewhere.	Chief Complaint
I'm always wary of hiccups, you know? Like they've got to get a bank check.	Chief Complaint
Are they going to be able to get a bank check? They've got to bring like $6,000 to closing, so is she going to have time to do that? Maybe she will, maybe she won't.	Chief Complaint
I don't know.	Chief Complaint
I'm not taking the risk of a personal check for $6,000.	Chief Complaint
I guess you have to.	Chief Complaint
The only way to be safe on a deposit is ten days.	Chief Complaint
Oh, really? Yeah.	Chief Complaint
I guess maybe at that point a bank can't dispute it against another bank.	Chief Complaint
You mean if it hasn't been returned in ten days, it's good? Right.	Chief Complaint
So Bank of America, if you deposit large amounts of money, will hold it for ten days, which I tell people they should get wire.	Chief Complaint
First I tell them they shouldn't do Bank of America, but they should get the money wired because the bank takes too long.	Chief Complaint
I didn't have anyone to go to the game with so I sent out an e-mail.	Chief Complaint
Now I'm getting all of these e-mails.	Chief Complaint
Is it time? Are we done? Not yet.	Chief Complaint
There was a lot of traffic, too.	Chief Complaint
Does this feel like just something else you just had to do this morning? No, not really.	Chief Complaint
It's like I did some work this morning.	Chief Complaint
Taking a shower I don't know why I just always feel is a chore but I had to take one today.	Chief Complaint
After two weeks, I've got to take a shower.	Chief Complaint
I need a haircut.	Chief Complaint
I should have gotten one today.	Chief Complaint
I always buy Supercuts.	Chief Complaint
Do you go to Supercuts? You get the $100 haircut.	Chief Complaint
It's $50, I think.	Others
It's gone up.	Others
Just after my Pilates class.	Chief Complaint
It's always a roll of the dice when you go to Supercuts.	Chief Complaint
You never know who you're going to get.	Chief Complaint
Shockingly, my hair is not easy to cut. They're afraid of me being bald and then on the top if it's too short, it sticks straight up.	Chief Complaint
I'm like, Just cut it short.	Chief Complaint
It will grow back.	Chief Complaint
It saves me money because it's the less I have to get my hair cut.	Chief Complaint
Cut it short and I'll let it grow long. I go like four times a year.	Chief Complaint
I was hoping we were somehow going to avoid Ian playing hockey.	Chief Complaint
It's just very expensive.	Chief Complaint
You've got to buy him equipment every year.	Chief Complaint
They can get used equipment, but there weren't any used helmets.	Chief Complaint
He had to buy a new helmet.	Chief Complaint
Jess bought it, so I don't care as much.	Chief Complaint
At some point, it gets expensive.	Chief Complaint
It should be entertaining, though, him learning to skate, falling all over the place, those little kids.	Chief Complaint
He hasn't been signed up yet, so I'm anxious about that.	Chief Complaint
I've got to sign him up and then we bring the check.	Chief Complaint
Where is it? You know where YMCA is? There's a rink two blocks from the house.	Chief Complaint
He's already been to the fire house, but.	Chief Complaint
Can't take too many trips to the fire house.	Chief Complaint
I guess not.	Chief Complaint
This Cub Scout stuff is kind of frequent.	Chief Complaint
There are lots of things to do.	Chief Complaint
There is another meeting.	Chief Complaint
There is a den meeting.	Chief Complaint
I'm trying to get it all straight between den/pack.	Chief Complaint
He is a busy fellow.	Others
He is.	Others
Soccer and hockey and Cub Scouts.	Chief Complaint
Soccer is gone.	Chief Complaint
Right.	Chief Complaint
But, yeah.	Chief Complaint
He's got a lot of energy, you know? If he's just sitting around the house, he just bounces.	Chief Complaint
He doesn't do it when he comes over to my place.	Chief Complaint
He just kind of sits, hangs out and watches TV.	Chief Complaint
He's pretty mellow.	Chief Complaint
We go out to dinner and he's mellow.	Chief Complaint
But when he's home with Jess, he pushes her a lot more than he pushes me. In fact, he really doesn't push me at all.	Chief Complaint
In what ways does he push her? Just not listening.	Chief Complaint
Bouncing around, not listening.	Chief Complaint
Don't bring food in here and he brings food in here.	Chief Complaint
Don't bring food in here and he brings food in here.	Chief Complaint
Up on the couch.	Chief Complaint
Right.	Chief Complaint
So, I don't know why he acts really different with me.	Chief Complaint
Just probably because he's around her enough that he knows her buttons.	Chief Complaint
He hasn't figured out mine yet.	Chief Complaint
Or maybe he fears me.	Chief Complaint
I tickle him.	Chief Complaint
You know, there could be any number of reasons.	Chief Complaint
I don't think it's that he's not around you enough not to know your buttons.	Chief Complaint
He would learn those pretty fast.	Chief Complaint
When he does come over he does spend a lot of time downstairs running around, so he gets a lot of his energy out. They're so loud.	Chief Complaint
I don't know.	Chief Complaint
I'm very much speculating here, but it sounds like Jess is sort of on him a fair amount and worries about him a lot and he could be kind of pushing back.	Chief Complaint
That's probably it.	Chief Complaint
That sounds more like Jess.	Chief Complaint
That's why I'm careful to say that I don't really know, but he just doesn't do the same thing with you.	Chief Complaint
There could be some of that on his side, too, where he feels a little needier for her in a way.	Chief Complaint
You know mom comforting stuff like that.	Chief Complaint
He kind of gives her a hard time because of that, which sometimes kids do.	Chief Complaint
Or is just trying to get attention.	Chief Complaint
Maybe it's to compete more with Lucille if it's around her.	Chief Complaint
Sure.	Chief Complaint
He's used to me ignoring him.	Chief Complaint
No.	Chief Complaint
It's probably not that.	Chief Complaint
I mean, I don't know how much you ignore him, but it's not something kids get used to.	Chief Complaint
I don't ignore him that much.	Chief Complaint
He asks so many damned questions.	Chief Complaint
He sounds like a very energetic, vigorous, curious, active kid.	Chief Complaint
Yeah.	Chief Complaint
That's great.	Chief Complaint
I mean, it's especially tough for the people who have to look after him all the time, I mean those are very nice qualities.	Chief Complaint
I'm not saying it's not the easiest one for you, but it's pretty nice.	Chief Complaint
It will be interesting.	Chief Complaint
He doesn't really seem I don't know.	Chief Complaint
He's kind of skinny, so it's like I don't know how he would do getting banged around in hockey.	Chief Complaint
When they're little they don't go flying into to each other. they just kind of bang into each other and fall down.	Chief Complaint
They don't know what they're doing unless they have another brother, and then they dominate.	Chief Complaint
I notice that with soccer.	Chief Complaint
All the kids with older brothers were much better.	Chief Complaint
I had a kid who scored seven goals who has two older brothers.	Chief Complaint
They play with them more and they have to play up to their brothers.	Chief Complaint
Like Lucille when she starts soccer she'll be much better than when Ian started soccer because she's already been kicking around a ball.	Chief Complaint
Lucille's another year-and-a-half.	Chief Complaint
it'll be two-and-a-half years before she can play.	Chief Complaint
Instead of being cranky sitting in her little stroller, at some point she'll become more wanting to play and run around.	Chief Complaint
She does that some, too, but sometimes she just wants to sit in the stroller and be cranky.	Chief Complaint
She doesn't want anything else.	Chief Complaint
It starts early.	Chief Complaint
I see you're choosing your words carefully.	Chief Complaint
How to respond to that one. I need coffee.	Chief Complaint
I'll just go home and make coffee.	Chief Complaint
It's such a pain, though.	Chief Complaint
Go home, the three or four minutes it takes it takes it awhile.	Chief Complaint
You've got to wash the pot out, empty the thing, put the filter in, and put the coffee in.	Chief Complaint
I don't know why.	Chief Complaint
These little things in life just get in my way.	Chief Complaint
The hiccups.	Chief Complaint
I wonder if Lucille is going to go with her grandmother when she picks her up today.	Chief Complaint
You mean she might get cranky? I'm hoping.	Chief Complaint
I'll be upset if she doesn't, if she doesn't go, Mama, mama, mama, mama.	Chief Complaint
Stand up in the car seat and go, No.	Chief Complaint
Is that what she does? That's what she did to me.	Chief Complaint
Wow.	Chief Complaint
She did not want to go with me.	Chief Complaint
When we got home she literally stood in the driveway and was going Mama, mama, mama, mama, Don't you want to play? She went, Mama, mama, mama, mama.	Chief Complaint
So I just sat down and waited it out.	Chief Complaint
Luckily Jess was only ten minutes.	Chief Complaint
It's hard being the daddy.	Family History
Yeah.	Family History
She doesn't see me often enough.	Family History
How often do you see her? I haven't seen her since Saturday.	Family History
Once or twice a week? Yeah, and not always for long periods of time.	Family History
Sometimes she won't interact with me if she's cranky.	Family History
There should be a coffee shop in this little square.	Family History
You can never have too many coffee shops.	Family History
I guess at some point I'm supposed to feed Ian.	Family History
You're going to need to feed him, I think.	Chief Complaint
I've got to figure out what to do.	Chief Complaint
It's such a pain in the ass.	Chief Complaint
We should stop for now.	Client Details
I'll see you on Tuesday next week, but I'm out on Friday.	Client Details
Okay.	Client Details
That's right, next week.	Client Details
I hope you weren't worried.	Client Details
No.	Chief Complaint
That I do it enough.	Chief Complaint
No.	Chief Complaint
You did that often.	Chief Complaint
