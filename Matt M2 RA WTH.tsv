See this is typical.	Chief Complaint
The constant movement and the lack of listening.	Chief Complaint
The teacher is getting frustrated and I know we are at home too.	Chief Complaint
How long has this been going on? Has it gotten worse? Well, it has been forever really, but definitely worse since starting kindergarten.	Chief Complaint
We waited to start him in school because of his energy level and inability to concentrate and sit still.	Client Details
He just turned six, but is older than many in his class.	Client Details
Keegan please don't stand on the chair.	Chief Complaint

Miss April makes me sit in the chair when I do it.	Chief Complaint

Me and Theo are in the chairs a lot.	Chief Complaint

It is so tall and it's like stairs going up.	Chief Complaint
Once I tried it.	Chief Complaint
I almost made it to the top.	Chief Complaint
He spends a lot of time in the chair for time out and I get a lot of calls for behavior issues.	Chief Complaint
I don't know what to do and am at my wits end between school and afterschool care.	Chief Complaint
Keegan, sit down and listen to the doctor.	Chief Complaint
Quit fidgeting.	Chief Complaint
Okay, first I am going to have you fill out a questionnaire and I will also send two with you for the teacher and afterschool care.	Chief Complaint
These will tell us about the various behaviors that are occurring at all three places.	Chief Complaint
Since the behavior has escalated since starting school, more information would be beneficial.	Chief Complaint
Okay.	Others
Isn't there some medicine you could give him? We are really having trouble here.	Chief Complaint
He has had his immunizations and his check up was normal before he started school.	Medical History
I am at a loss here.	Chief Complaint

who knows where. He also has trouble with interrupting and just not answering when talked to.	Chief Complaint
He forgets to put his lunch in his backpack in the mornings.	Chief Complaint
This has been happening more in the last six months since starting kindergarten.	Chief Complaint
He always was full of energy and was busy.	Chief Complaint
In daycare, he was always in time out, but you know how that goes with so many kids to watch and he was just excited to have playmates, being an only child and all.	Chief Complaint
Hey, are we done yet? This is boring.	Chief Complaint
I want to go home and play. Stop interrupting.	Chief Complaint
We will be going in a bit.	Others
Sit still.	Chief Complaint
How about sleeping and eating habits? Is there history of previous medical conditions or issues? Bedtime is 8:00 pm and if he has a hard time falling asleep, we let him watch movies on his TV in his room.	Medical History
He eats normal fine.	Client Details
We limit sugar because of his hyper behavior.	Client Details
He is healthy otherwise.	Client Details
Let's move to the lab.	Others
Medication can be helpful, and I would also suggest counselling in conjunction to get the best results.	Chief Complaint
As a family, the counselling can help with communication, problem solving and coping with situations that arise in school or after school.	Chief Complaint
We will see you back for a follow-up in week and see how the medication and counseling is working.	Chief Complaint
Hey, can I please go now? I will jump off the chair on my way.	Chief Complaint

Thank you for coming in today.	Others
What can I do for you? We have some concerns about our daughter and have had some reports from her teachers and afterschool staff.	Chief Complaint
She has a difficult time concentrating, listening and following directions and seems to be in her own world a lot of the time.	Chief Complaint
Have there been issues with losing or forgetting things? Constantly.	Chief Complaint
Following through is a battle too. She is easily distracted and it is hard to complete simple tasks.	Chief Complaint
School is a source of negativity and avoidance.	Chief Complaint
Her teachers have been concerned for some time.	Chief Complaint
One though she might be having small seizures when she spaces out.	Chief Complaint
We had her checked and everything is fine.	Chief Complaint
She isn't having seizures, thank God.	Chief Complaint
So, one teacher thought she might need a consult about attention deficit.	Chief Complaint

No.	Others
It's hard to do the papers.	Chief Complaint
I don't have a favorite part.	Chief Complaint
I like to come home and play.	Chief Complaint
How about eye contact, has this been a problem to get engagement when visiting. I notice a lot of squirming and fidgeting, but the eyes are averting and the questions appear uncomfortable.	Chief Complaint
Is this usual, if so, and how long have you noticed it? Well it has been forever really, but definitely worse since starting school this year.	Chief Complaint
Kindergarten and first grade she did have some teachers report concerns about not paying attention and she does have trouble staying in her seat.	Chief Complaint

Her teacher says she does this when they are in the middle of a lesson.	Chief Complaint
She also makes a lot of mistakes on her schoolwork, careless mistakes.	Chief Complaint
It is reported that her work is messy and often incomplete.	Chief Complaint
She has always had a difficult time with her room and keeping track of toys, clothes and other personal belongings.	Chief Complaint
At first the teacher was concerned that she had a hearing issue because she doesn't always listen when talked to.	Chief Complaint
She just spaces out.	Chief Complaint
She doesn't really seem too concerned about social interaction with the other kids and they don't really accept her.	Chief Complaint
Are we done yet? I want to go home.	Chief Complaint

I play with the little kids.	Social History
Do you feel you are smart? Do you like to learn new things in school? No.	Chief Complaint
The papers are hard.	Chief Complaint
The teacher gets upset and I have to stay in and work on them at recess.	Chief Complaint
She spends a lot of time in the chair in front of the TV at afterschool care.	Chief Complaint
Her teachers say she has a difficult time completing tasks.	Chief Complaint
Her papers at school always come home with her unfinished and we to try to work at them at home after dinner.	Chief Complaint
She also spends her recesses inside to finish school work.	Chief Complaint

They also report that she is not adapting well socially.	Chief Complaint
She always struggled with this.	Chief Complaint
She is not invited to birthday parties and hardly any children came to her party when invited.	Social History
OK, first I am going to have you, parents, fill out a questionnaire and I will also send copies with you for the teachers to fill out.	Chief Complaint
These will tell us about the various behaviors that are occurring at all home, school and after school care.	Chief Complaint
We need to rule out other etiology and then may visit about the benefits of starting her on a stimulant.	Chief Complaint
Last year we weren't really wanting to do the medication, but now it seems like she needs help and we are more open to this idea.	Medical History
We are really having trouble here.	Chief Complaint
Her immunizations are current and check-up was normal before starting school.	Medical History
We are at a loss and need to see some hope.	Chief Complaint
We will rule out other etiology first, then look at medications.	Chief Complaint
I will have you fill out the questionnaire and have the teachers and principals fill one out and return them.	Chief Complaint
How about sleeping and eating habits? Is there history of previous medical conditions or issues? Bedtime is 8:00 p.m. and if she has a hard time falling asleep, we let her watch movies to wind down.	Client Details
She eats normal, fine, she has never been a big eater.	Client Details
She is healthy seems content and happy enough at home.	Client Details

Well, sometimes I feel like it would be ok if I didn't wake up.	Chief Complaint

Do you feel like you could hurt someone else other than yourself? No.	Chief Complaint
My wife makes me angry though and sometimes I throw things.	Chief Complaint

It helped for a while.	Medical History

I'm tired of everything.	Chief Complaint
Would you be willing to try counselling and medication again to help you? I guess if it will help.	Chief Complaint

# Matt T7
Hi, I'm one of the psychiatrists who work here in the Department of Psychological Medicine and you are? Elizabeth, but everyone calls me Liz.	Client Details
I have spoken with your physician, Dr. Green, and have read his reports and know some of the things about why you are here today.	Medical History
However, I would like to hear from you why you have come to see me today.	Others
I am having trouble with fear of germs and fear of intruders coming to attack my family.	Chief Complaint
I feel that if I don't do certain things each day that bad things will happen.	Chief Complaint
Would you like to tell me about your troubles with cleaning, checking and counting and what you feel will happen if you don't do these? If you have questions or don't understand something at any point during this interview, please feel free to ask me for clarification.	Chief Complaint
Are you comfortable telling me about your troubles specifically? Yes.	Chief Complaint
I would like to get your help because I can't seem to get through the day without these rituals taking so much time out of my life.	Chief Complaint
They are getting worse.	Chief Complaint
Are you a person who is careful about safety? Is there anything in the house that you check on frequently? Do you have to do the same thing over and over again or in a certain way? Yes, I feel the need to wash my hands constantly.	Chief Complaint
I am afraid of getting germs from things that other people touch.	Chief Complaint
I feel I need to wash them three times every time I touch something that someone else may have touched, such as a door knob, light switch or a faucet handle.	Chief Complaint
I usually use a paper towel to open things so I don't have to touch anything directly.	Chief Complaint
If I touch something and I don't wash three times, then I am afraid that I will get germs that could cause me to get sick.	Chief Complaint
I have fears that I forget to lock the door or turn off lights, so I will go and turn the lock three times and then need to wash my hands three times.	Chief Complaint
I find this happening so much that I am late for my job.	Chief Complaint
In the morning on my way to work I have had to turn around and drive home to see if I remembered to turn off the coffee pot.	Chief Complaint
This is embarrassing because I know what I am doing but I can't stop it.	Chief Complaint
What do you feel will happen if you do not do these things over and over? I am afraid that I will get some bad germs that will get into my body and if I don't lock the door, then someone will come and attack me and my family.	Chief Complaint
If I don't check the doors and windows and lock everything three times, I just feel that something bad will happen.	Chief Complaint
Then I am afraid that I forgot to lock the doors and windows, so I am repeatedly checking on them.	Chief Complaint
Then I must wash my hands three times because of the germs.	Chief Complaint
How any times do you wash your hands a day? Probably 60 times.	Chief Complaint
I have contact dermatitis on my hands because they are irritated from the constant washing.	Medical History
Do you find that you need to change your clothing more than once a day. Yes.	Chief Complaint
I change after I come in from work or being out in public.	Chief Complaint
I have separate laundry hampers for my clothes, depending on where I wore them.	Chief Complaint
Work is different than the grocery store.	Chief Complaint
How many times are you checking the locks on the doors and windows? I check everything before I leave for work, when I come home from work and before bed and waking in the morning.	Chief Complaint
If I check three times, then it feels right.	Chief Complaint
I feel relief if I check and count three times.	Chief Complaint
How about your sleeping habits? Have you had any trouble with sleep? I wake up anxious during the night and sometimes must check things in the house like the windows, doors, coffee pot, and lights in the garage and closets.	Chief Complaint
Then I try to go back to sleep and sometimes I lay awake for hours.	Chief Complaint
So yes, my sleep is interrupted by the checking.	Chief Complaint
Do these actions seem reasonable to you or more than you should be doing? Do you spend more time on these than you would like to? I feel that I must do everything three times.	Chief Complaint
The washing, counting and checking takes up so much time and I know it is not normal.	Chief Complaint
I want to stop.	Chief Complaint
I want to feel normal again.	Chief Complaint
I have always been particular about things, but this is really taking over my life.	Chief Complaint
I want to stop but if I don't do the counting, checking and washing, then it doesn't feel right.	Chief Complaint
I feel relief when I do these things.	Chief Complaint
It's only temporary relief, but relief nonetheless.	Chief Complaint
How do these things effect your life? Your job, relationships with your husband, kids, friends? It's terrible.	Social History
My husband is so understanding, but worried and wants me to get help because it is disruptive in our household.	Social History
The kids wonder why I must do everything three times and why I can't touch certain things in the house because of the fear of germs.	Social History
I don't want them to learn these things from me.	Social History
I work as an accountant, so I have my own office and don't have to interact a lot with the public.	Social History
I just wipe my phone down with bleached wipes every time I come into my office.	Chief Complaint
I also wipe the door knob or avoid it.	Chief Complaint
I don't know if anyone at work knows the extent of my compulsions.	Social History
I think my secretary knows because she has worked or me for the past ten years, since I started.	Social History
How many kids do you have and what are the ages? We have three kids.	Family History
The oldest is 8, the middle is 6 and the youngest is 4.	Family History
The 4-year-old is just starting to mimic how I use a paper towel to open things.	Family History
I don't want this to affect them.	Chief Complaint
I don't want them to get what I have.	Chief Complaint
How much control do you feel you have over these actions? Do you resist them or yield to them? I yield because I can't resist and the feeling that something bad will happen just overwhelms me.	Chief Complaint
Are you currently taking any medications? Either prescription or over the counter? I take a multi-vitamin and Tylenol or Advil for headaches, which isn't often.	Medical History
How about any alcohol or illicit drug use? Ever in the past? I drank a bit in college.	Client Details
Never smoked.	Client Details
Do you recall when you first had these compulsions? I'm 36 and I was about twelve or thirteen when things started for sure.	Medical History
I started to really avoid anything that had contact with others (hands mainly).	Chief Complaint
I always was worried about being attacked or mugged by some criminal.	Chief Complaint
I have always been a clean and neat person from childhood.	Client Details
Is there anyone in your family who had these same tendencies that you can recall? My mother was a very neat and kept person.	Family History
She was very particular about how she kept house and her personal appearance.	Family History
My dad was a salesman and was well kept, but not more than other people I guess.	Family History
My siblings, a brother and sister, are messier than I am, most definitely.	Family History
Are there any forms of abuse in your past as a child or in your current life as an adult? No.	Client Details
No physical or sexual abuse at all.	Client Details
Have you experienced any major losses or grieving? Well my mother died right after we were married about eleven years ago or maybe ten.	Family History
It was right before I started my position with the accounting firm.	Family History
My father passed just before we were married, while I was still in college.	Family History
My siblings are both living and healthy.	Family History
Do you think the counting and washing increased before you started your job? Well, yes it did.	Chief Complaint
Before your mother passed? No.	Chief Complaint
It was just after her funeral.	Chief Complaint
That's when I felt the need to count and to wash more often.	Chief Complaint
I felt so low.	Chief Complaint
Have you ever had ideas of suicide or homicide? I wanted to die right after my mother passed.	Medical History
I was depressed and felt so low, but I didn't attempt suicide.	Medical History
I don't have ideas of homicide.	Chief Complaint
Quite the opposite.	Chief Complaint
I am worried about keeping my family safe.	Chief Complaint
I am worried about being attacked.	Chief Complaint
Were you treated for depression or any other mental issues in the past, such as after your mother's passing? No.	Medical History
I just recently went to Dr. Green because this is becoming too much.	Medical History
Would you be willing to try medication, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and Exposure and Response Prevention therapy to begin changing these behaviors? Yes.	Chief Complaint
If it will help me stop this and be able to have my life back.	Chief Complaint
According to Dr. Green's records, an MRI shows negative and blood work looks normal so we will begin today and I will follow-up with you in one week.	Medical History
# Matt T8
Hi Ann, I'm one of the psychiatrists who work here in the Department of Psychological Medicine and I'm seeing you today because you were referred up from A&E.	Client Details
I understand that you were there a couple of nights ago, having cut your arms and I think you'd come in after your relationship had ended, is that right? Yeah.	Chief Complaint
Ok, ok. Can I just check - have they bandaged you up? And are things are settling down there? Yeah, it's fine now.	Chief Complaint
Ok. How have you been, since we last saw you in Emergency Room? Crap, I mean, I just can't believe that he's gone.	Chief Complaint
Right and this is your boyfriend, is that right? Yeah.	Client Details
Ok. How long had you two been together? I mean it was only a couple of weeks, but you know things seemed to be going really, really well.	Social History
I don't understand.	Chief Complaint
I can't believe he's just gone.	Chief Complaint
Right, what happened between you two to bring that relationship to an end? Well it's like I said, because it was going so well, you know, I asked him to move in and he said that he didn't want to and we ended up arguing and getting into a big fight and we threw stuff at each other and then he said he was going and you know, I begged him not to but, he still went anyway.	Chief Complaint
So was it after he had gone that you cut yourself? Yeah.	Chief Complaint
Right and can you tell me a bit more about what happened when you cut yourself? Well, he'd gone and I just felt so.	Chief Complaint
I just couldn't bear the pain anymore Right and like the voices were just incessant.	Chief Complaint
Right.	Others
And I just, you know, just wanted to get rid of all the pain, all the voices and so you know.	Chief Complaint
I just cut myself.	Chief Complaint
And did that help with the pain and the voices? Yeah it was just.	Chief Complaint
Yeah, I mean.	Chief Complaint
Yeah, it took the pain away and I don't know there's just something about seeing blood really.	Chief Complaint
Right.	Others
It just made it feel better.	Chief Complaint
So with the cutting, is this something that you have done before? Yeah, I've been doing it since I was, don't know, a teenager.	Medical History
Ok. And it sounds like there are times when you do it when it helps? Yeah.	Chief Complaint
Right.	Others
It takes the pain off.	Chief Complaint
And are there any down sides to the cutting? Well yeah, there's been a few but I suppose the main thing is, I don't know, my arms and legs are a mess.	Chief Complaint
Ok. And you mentioned voices? and I know you've spoken to doctors about them before but can I just ask you a few more questions about them please, if that's ok? Yeah	Medical History
Ok. Can you tell me how long it is that you've been hearing the voices? That's since I was a teenager as well.	Medical History
Ok. And do you know how many voices are there? Or who they are? Oh I know who they are, yeah.	Chief Complaint
It's mainly my step-dad.	Chief Complaint
Right.	Others
He, I don't know, he just tells me how dirty I am.	Chief Complaint
Right and how horrible I am.	Chief Complaint
And I don't know sometimes it's my mum as well.	Chief Complaint
What kind of things does your mum say? Ermm, I think mainly she thinks I'm a liar.	Chief Complaint
Ok. And how often is that you get these voices? They're not there all the time.	Chief Complaint
Right.	Others
But yeah, you know, generally they are sort of like, sort of sitting there.	Chief Complaint
Just sometimes they are louder than others.	Chief Complaint
It's like the other night, they might as well have been in the room.	Chief Complaint
Did you think they were in the room? No, I mean I know that they're not there.	Chief Complaint
Ok.	Others
But it's like they're just so loud in my head.	Chief Complaint
Right, so can I just clarify that? Do the voices seem as though they are inside your head or is it like my voice, coming through your ears? No, it's like inside, inside my head.	Chief Complaint
Okay okay and am I right in thinking that they trouble you more at times when you are stressed out? Yeah.	Chief Complaint
Right.	Others
Can I ask you a few more general questions about how you are, in your mood? How would you say that you feel generally, kind of in yourself? I hate myself.	Chief Complaint
Right.	Others
Most of the time it's not, I just don't like being me.	Chief Complaint
Right.	Others
That sounds as though it can be very difficult sometimes and it sounds like you've used to cutting in the past to help, are there any other things you do to help when you're feeling really bad? Ermm, drinking.	Chief Complaint
Right.	Others
I have smoked a few puffs now and then, you know.	Chief Complaint
Right.	Others
I don't do it so much now but in the past I don't know.	Chief Complaint
I just had a funny thing about food.	Chief Complaint
Right.	Others
You know, I would sort of like binge and then just throw it back up again.	Chief Complaint
Right,	Others
Ok, and that was in the past but not recently? I haven't done it recently.	Chief Complaint
Ok and can I ask it sounds like when you cut the other night you were doing it sort of to get rid of the pain.	Chief Complaint
Can I just clarify, were you doing it to try and kill yourself? No.	Chief Complaint
Have there ever been times in the past when you have tried to kill yourself? In my late teens.	Medical History
Right, What happened then? Around when I was 19.	Medical History
I don't know, it just got to the point where I didn't want to be here anymore so I took some tablets.	Medical History
Right, Ok.	Others
So that was in your late teens? And at the time you took the tablets because you wanted to be dead, is that right? Ok.	Medical History
But you've not wanted to be dead, since that time in your late teens? No, no.	Medical History
Can I ask you a few more general questions about your home situation? Who is it that, Is there anyone at home with you? Well not now.	Client Details
Right.	Others
But my daughter used to live with me.	Family History
But she's gone to live with her dad now.	Family History
Right.	Others
So she's gone to live with her dad.	Family History
is that quite a recent thing? About a year ago.	Family History
What was that about? Erm, she just couldn't cope with the fact that I was cutting myself. Right.	Family History
I mean, I didn't do it in front of her but she knew it was happening.	Family History
Right.	Others
And I suppose, I suppose one of the big things as well was the relationships I had.	Family History
The relationships you had? Can you tell me a bit more about that? Well it's like the one I've just had with my current boyfriend, you know.	Social History
It starts off being great and then I get, I get really scared, get really scared that they're going to leave.	Social History
And then it turns into a big fight and then they end up leaving anyway.	Social History
And it sounds like your daughter struggled with that? Yeah, I mean, suppose she didn't know whether she was coming or going really.	Family History
Right.	Others
Ok and were there a lot of relationships like that? Yeah.	Social History
Ok, ok. You've seen a few people in the past.	Social History
you've seen a couple of psychiatrists and a couple of counselors.	Medical History
Has anything that anyone's done for you before been particularly helpful? They've been crap.	Medical History
I just feel like I've been passed from pillar to pillar.	Medical History
Right.	Others
So you've not found anything that people have done particularly helpful, in helping you to manage your relationships, and your cutting and the things that seem to go wrong for you? Well it's like, it's like nobody's listening to me.	Chief Complaint
Right.	Others
You know, I think you're the only person who has actually sat and listened to what I've got to say.	Chief Complaint
Ok. Well do you think it would be worth given that this, this has been such a longstanding problem that clearly does get in the way of quite a lot of aspects of your life? Do you think it would be worth us meeting again, one more time, and perhaps having a think together about how the service could best support you with this? What do you mean one more time? Can't I see you, you know, sort of properly? Well the way that we work here in this department is that we see people once or twice and try and think, with them, about the best place for them to be.	Chief Complaint
And then refer them on to the most appropriate part of the service.	Chief Complaint
So it wouldn't be usual for me to see you more than once or twice.	Chief Complaint
Yeah but you've you've like I said, you're the only person that's listened to me.	Chief Complaint
I know it's very difficult to open up to people and I know that you have opened up here today and it can feel quite hard that you're not going to continue to see me.	Chief Complaint
But it is the way that we work here, is to pass you on to somebody who is perhaps a bit more appropriate for your needs.	Chief Complaint
Right.	Others
So, would it be ok for me to book you in to come back and see me, say next week for our second appointment? And we can, perhaps, have a think of where to go from there? Would that be ok? Yeah, I suppose so.	Client Details
# Matt T9
Hi, I'm one of the psychiatrists who work here in the Department of Psychological Medicine and you are? Taylor.	Client Details
I have spoken with your physician, Dr. White, and have read his reports and know some of the things about why you are here today.	Medical History
However, I would like to hear from you why you have come to see me today.	Others
I am having trouble sleeping.	Chief Complaint
Well, I should say I don't want to sleep.	Chief Complaint
Sleep brings nightmares with it and I have the same nightmare over and over.	Chief Complaint
I was wondering if I could get something to help me sleep and forget past events.	Chief Complaint
Dr. White also indicated that you are having some other concerns.	Medical History
Would you like to tell me about your concerns other than sleep? I would also add that if you have questions or don't understand something at any point during this interview, please feel free to ask me for clarification.	Chief Complaint
Are you comfortable telling me about your troubles specifically? Yes.	Chief Complaint
I would like to get your help because I feel like I can't live my life.	Chief Complaint
I am not wanting to be around groups of people.	Chief Complaint
I feel irritable and have been having trouble concentrating and remembering things.	Chief Complaint
I don't have an appetite and feel nauseated a lot lately.	Chief Complaint
I am 28 years old and feel like an old lady.	Chief Complaint
Can you tell me when these symptoms started? Really, I have had nightmares for years, throughout my childhood and now I am 28 and still having them.	Chief Complaint
I never like sleep and try to avoid it and need only about five hours a night.	Chief Complaint
The anxious and irritable feelings have increased more in the last few months, I guess.	Chief Complaint
I noticed my nausea and loss of appetite since the separation from my husband and since moving into my grandparents' house again.	Chief Complaint
Is there something, a change within your life, or a trigger that occurred that you recall before the symptoms began? Are you having any distressing memories that keep coming back or maybe a situation where you feel scared or really want to avoid? Well I have just moved back to town this last year with me two young daughters.	Client Details
I am living in my grandparents' house.	Client Details
they have both passed.	Family History
I noticed after I moved in that I don't feel settled and have the symptoms I just spoke of.	Chief Complaint
Do you ever have times of great fear or have panic attacks? Do you drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs? I believe this all began with a panic attack.	Medical History
I thought I was having heart issues, but realized that I was having a panic attack.	Medical History
I just figured it was due to the split with my husband and moving back to my hometown and into the old house.	Chief Complaint
I smoke cigarettes, a pack a day, started when I quit alcohol.	Client Details
I went through treatment for my drinking and have been sober 8 years.	Medical History
No drug use otherwise.	Medical History
That is great that you have been sober for eight years.	Client Details
Do you have specific memories of this house as a child? Are they memories of pleasure or fear? I loved my grandparents as a child.	Family History
I love this house, except for the basement.	Chief Complaint
I used to have to play with my cousin in the basement.	Family History
He was not a nice person, five years older than me and liked to teach me all sorts of things, sexual things.	Family History
I was only five at the time and didn't understand.	Family History
I felt dirty and ashamed.	Chief Complaint
I didn't tell anyone until I was an adult.	Chief Complaint
I have gone to counselling for this as an adult.	Medical History
no one else knows.	Family History
Your family does not know about this abuse from your cousin? No, No way.	Family History
I told a counselor once.	Medical History
I can't tell them because all it would do is cause pain for the family.	Family History
It's over and done and I just want to move on with my life.	Chief Complaint
I have just separated from my husband and want to move on with my life.	Social History
Do you know about family history or any mental illness or other medical issues? My mom was depressed and has issues.	Family History
She's never been treated.	Family History
My dad is fine no problems.	Family History
No other medical issues that I know of.	Family History
Was your husband physically or emotionally or mentally abusive to you? Yes, Emotionally and mentally.	Family History
Not always, but we just couldn't seem to work things out.	Chief Complaint
I grew up with my step-dad abusing my mom, so I recognized the cycle and didn't want to get to the physical abuse stage.	Family History
Has anyone else sexually or physically abused you? Just my cousin.	Family History
My mom was pretty physical.	Family History
She would get beat, then us kids would get beat.	Family History
It was just messed up.	Chief Complaint
I am on my own now and away from all of that.	Chief Complaint
What about your children? Have they been exposed to any abuses? No way.	Family History
I make sure that they are not left with anyone other than my sister and my grandmother when she was alive.	Family History
They don't have sleep overs and they know about good and bad touch.	Family History
How old are your daughters? One is five and one is seven.	Family History
They are good girls.	Family History
Do you think the ages of your daughters may trigger some of your memories? Probably.	Chief Complaint
They are so small and innocent, I can't go there.	Family History
How about mental or emotional abuse? Did you experience either or both of these? My mom was a yeller and threw things.	Family History
She cursed a lot and was not a happy person.	Family History
She had me when she was sixteen, so we always kind of clashed.	Family History
My husband was also a yeller and controller.	Family History
He means to protect me, but it goes too far.	Family History
Have you had other therapy or medications in the past, perhaps when you saw the counselors in the past? No medications and just basically talked about things that have happened in the past.	Medical History
Sometimes I feel stuck and need to talk to my counselor, if that makes sense.	Chief Complaint
Yes, it does, and that is a healthy action to take.	Chief Complaint
How about your irritability and memory issues mentioned earlier, can you tell me more specifically about these symptoms? I feel that I have less patience with my daughters and I also feel that I space out more.	Chief Complaint
having a hard time concentrating and sticking with tasks.	Chief Complaint
I find myself wanting to go drive with the girls.	Chief Complaint
You know, just get in the car and drive.	Chief Complaint
It just feels confining in the house all the time, but I don't want to be around bunches of people.	Chief Complaint
Have you felt depressed? I have always been mildly more sad than usual, I guess.	Chief Complaint
Lately I feel like I am suffocating and like I need space.	Chief Complaint
I want to be alone.	Chief Complaint
Have you had feelings of suicide or homicide? No.	Chief Complaint
Suicide was a thought as I was growing up, but I can't leave my girls.	Chief Complaint
When my parents divorced I wanted to die and later when they both remarried. I have talked to my counselor about that too, the suicide stuff.	Chief Complaint
Do you or have you ever had a suicide plan? I used to when I was a teenager.	Client Details
I would take a bunch of pills or just get into my mom's car and turn it on and go to sleep in the closed-up garage.	Client Details
That was when I was in junior high and high school.	Client Details
I couldn't leave my girls though.	Client Details
Do you notice any symptoms of feeling jumpy and anxious? More so in my grandparents' house.	Chief Complaint
I had the panic attack and I don't feel entirely safe in the house.	Chief Complaint
I just figured I was not used to living on my own.	Chief Complaint
I am scared of something happening to my daughters and I will not be able to protect them.	Chief Complaint
I wake up from my nightmares and feel an overwhelming sense that I can't protect them.	Chief Complaint
I go check on them after my heart slows and my shaking quits from the nightmare.	Chief Complaint
Can you talk about the nightmares? Are they the same or different? They are mostly the same.	Chief Complaint
Someone is in the house chasing me and I need to save my family before he gets to them and kills us all.	Chief Complaint
They are dark dreams.	Chief Complaint
I don't share with anyone outside of counseling.	Social History
I learned my dreams were not normal dreams when I was growing up and my friends would look petrified as I told them about the killing, chasing and fear.	Social History
I wake up in a sweat, out of breath and my heart racing.	Chief Complaint
I then must get up and sit for a bit, so I don't go back into the same dream.	Chief Complaint
Five hours of sleep is your average you say? Do you nap during the day? No.	Chief Complaint
Naps can bring on very bad dreams, some of the worst.	Chief Complaint
I avoid napping.	Chief Complaint
I also work at an insurance office and don't have time to sleep more than I do.	Client Details
Is there something you are very concerned about or afraid of happening? What do you worry about? I worry about my daughters being harmed like I was.	Chief Complaint
I also worry about how the separation with my husband will affect them.	Chief Complaint
When my parents divorced, it was devastating to me. My life just went downhill.	Chief Complaint
Can you tell me more about what you mean by your life went downhill? My mom married an alcoholic that beat her and then she beat us.	Family History
The cops were at our house a lot to break up the fighting.	Family History
It was embarrassing.	Family History
We didn't eat well or often and I usually cooked for my sister and step-brother, because my mom and step-dad were at the bar.	Family History
We ate a lot of pancakes.	Family History
It was all I knew how to cook at nine years old and the batter is cheap.	Family History
I missed my dad.	Family History
He never raised his voice or hit anyone.	Family History
He was the opposite of my step-dad.	Family History
We moved every year I was in school.	Client Details
Sometimes across the street or sometimes across town.	Client Details
I got behind in school because of changing so many times and I learned to not get too close to friends.	Client Details
There is a test called the ACE Study, Adverse Childhood Experiences Study.	Client Details
Have you heard of this study or taken any tests for depression? No.	Medical History
Have you taken any tests for depression or trauma? No.	Medical History
Have you heard of post-traumatic stress disorder? Yes, when soldiers come home and have a hard time adapting back into normal life, right? That is correct.	Chief Complaint
There are other situations where people can have PTSD such as traumatic stressful events such as car accidents, living through a natural disaster, witnessing traumatic events, or living in abusive situations.	Chief Complaint
There are some key symptoms such as re-experiencing the event, arousal or hypervigilance and avoidance.	Chief Complaint
These are symptoms we have discussed today and we could continue with treatment options if you are interested? I am interested.	Chief Complaint
I need to not feel so scared and worn out.	Chief Complaint
What types of treatment? Do I have to get my mom or dad involved, because I don't want to do that, you know? No.	Chief Complaint
Everything here is confidential.	Chief Complaint
There is a therapy that we could start called Prolonged Exposure Therapy, which is just looking at the memories in a safe environment and trying to re-train pathways in your brain.	Chief Complaint
We could also look at some medications for anxiety and depression.	Chief Complaint
Does this sound like something you would like to pursue? Yes, I will try.	Chief Complaint
We are going to have some lab work done before we look at medications and we will begin treatment.	Chief Complaint

Hi, Lila.	Client Details
Do you want to come on in and have a seat? I'm the on-call psychiatrist for this afternoon.	Others
I got a call this morning, from your family doctor, because I think you went to see him this morning, along with your mum and I gather that things have been a little bit difficult for you, you've had some rather distressing experiences.	Chief Complaint
So I think your doctor thought it might be helpful for us to have a bit of a discussion about that, to see if I could help you.	Chief Complaint
Would that be alright with you? That's fine.	Chief Complaint
Would it be alright, for you to tell me a little bit about what's been going on? Well, you're going to think it sounds stupid but my roommates are working for CIA.	Chief Complaint
And they're they're doing stuff to my brain.	Chief Complaint
Ok. And they're they're out to get me, Ok.	Chief Complaint
That must be very difficult for you? How long has this been going on for you? Yeah, for about 2 months.	Chief Complaint
You are 22, right? Right.	Client Details
How did you first figure out this is what was happening? Yeah, I came home one time and they had moved the, they'd moved the microwave from its stand onto the counter.	Chief Complaint
And I just, I knew then.	Chief Complaint
And what was it that you knew at that moment? That erm that they worked for CIA.	Chief Complaint
Right, Ok.	Others
So it's been going on a couple of months? Yeah, this new lecturer started at university and she works for the CIA.	Chief Complaint
And she basically drafted my roommates in, turned them against me.	Chief Complaint
Ok. Now I've noticed a couple of times, while we've been talking, that you've sort of looked round you, into the room as if you're checking for something.	Chief Complaint
Could I ask you what's happening at those times? Well I can, I can hear them talking about me.	Chief Complaint
Right.	Others
Who is it you can hear? My roommates.	Chief Complaint
So you recognize it as their voices? Yeah, I can.	Chief Complaint
I can hear them all the time.	Chief Complaint
Right.	Others
How many voices can you hear? One is louder and the others are kind of whispering.	Chief Complaint
They talk all the time.	Chief Complaint
Ok. And do they sound real, like my voice sounds talking to you now? Yeah, it's odd.	Chief Complaint
Right.	Others
So when they're not in the house with you? Yeah, it's like they're in the other room or something.	Chief Complaint
Ok. And can you hear what they're actually saying? Yeah, they're talking about me.	Chief Complaint
They're always commenting on everything that I'm doing.	Chief Complaint
It is usually what I am doing wrong.	Chief Complaint
It is hard not to talk back sometimes.	Chief Complaint
Right.	Others
Can you give me an example of what they would say? Well like if I'm packing my bag to go to university or something they'll be, they'll comment on that like, 'she's left the house now', or you know 'she's opening the door now'.	Chief Complaint
Ok.	Others
Anything else? Do they ever talk to each other, perhaps, about you? Yeah, Right.	Chief Complaint
And they're saying, like, I'm making trouble.	Chief Complaint
And I am not smart enough and that they're going to get me.	Chief Complaint
Ok. What about actually talking directly to you, in the way that I am talking to you now? Does that ever happen? No.	Chief Complaint
But Sometimes I see spiders where I know they can't be, like in the fridge.	Chief Complaint
Ok.	Others
So you've been hearing the voices of your roommates, and seeing spiders in the fridge, have there been any other changes? Have there been any changes, perhaps, to the way you're thinking? Sometimes people tell us that their thinking changes in some way.	Chief Complaint
so for example, they might feel that they are getting thoughts put into their head, that aren't their own.	Chief Complaint
Have you had any experiences like that? Yeah.	Chief Complaint
I do think things that, that aren't me.	Chief Complaint
Ok. Like they are putting thing they're putting stuff into my brain it's not, it's not me.	Chief Complaint
It's not, I'm not thinking	Chief Complaint
So different thoughts in your brain? Yeah.	Chief Complaint
It's like it's stupid stuff as well.	Chief Complaint
It's like the other day I suddenly started thinking about some Simpsons Cartoon and I don't watch any of that crap.	Chief Complaint
Right.	Others
It's not your kind of thing normally? They're not they're not my thoughts.	Chief Complaint
Ok. And do you have any idea how that's happening or who's responsible? It's CIA.	Chief Complaint
It's this chip they've put in my head.	Chief Complaint
Right, Okay.	Others
I can feel it all the time.	Chief Complaint
Ok.	Others
So, you're getting thoughts put into your brain that aren't your own.	Chief Complaint
What about a different sort of experience, what about the experience that somehow other people are able to know what you're thinking, even though you haven't actually told them? No, They're no.	Chief Complaint
Nothing like that? They're just putting stuff in my head.	Chief Complaint
Just putting stuff in and can I just check as well, that you're not getting the experience when your thoughts just stop all together? Like you have no thoughts left? No.	Chief Complaint
If anything there's too much in there.	Chief Complaint
I wish I could unplug it.	Chief Complaint
Ok. Just get this thing out of my head.	Chief Complaint
Right.	Others
And you mentioned this, this chip, or this device in your brain, do you want to tell me a bit more about that? Well it's it's a tracking device.	Chief Complaint
So they know where I am at all times.	Chief Complaint
I can feel it moving round, like rotating round.	Chief Complaint
I think the spiders are working with them.	Chief Complaint
Ok, so you can feel the physical sensation in your brain? Yeah, yeah.	Chief Complaint
Ok, that must be very difficult for you.	Chief Complaint
I don't know why they're doing this to me.	Chief Complaint
I've done nothing wrong.	Chief Complaint
Ok. Can I just check? are there any problems with the rest of your body? Any changes in sensation or any bits that feels different in any way? No, I feel fine.	Chief Complaint
I'm not ill or anything.	Chief Complaint
Ok, I just want this thing out my head.	Chief Complaint
Ok, it sounds like a very difficult time for you.	Chief Complaint
Can I ask you, how are you coping with all this? How is it affecting you? Well, I've not been leaving my room much.	Chief Complaint
And, so I have to wait until they go out, just to go down and get some food but They've been doing stuff to my food, like the spiders in the fridge.	Chief Complaint
Ok. What do you think is happening to your food? They're, they're poisoning it.	Chief Complaint
Right.	Others
Ok. are you actually eating much at the moment? No.	Chief Complaint
Ok. Now with all this happening, it sounds like you don't feel very safe.	Chief Complaint
Have I got that right? Have you felt the need, I don't know, to take steps to protect yourself in any way? Well, I've, I've got some bear spray.	Chief Complaint
And I've got like a softball bat.	Chief Complaint
It's just in case they get in my room, I just	Chief Complaint
I don't want to hurt anyone but I just feel like I've got to protect myself, it's like, like they're cornering me to do this.	Chief Complaint
Right, Ok. Have you felt the need to use either the bear spray or the softball bat, so far? Take it out with you for protection? No, no, I don't want to get caught.	Chief Complaint
Ok. Has it ever got so bad that you've felt the need to hurt yourself, or even kill yourself as the only way out, the only way of coping with this? Well I, I thought about getting some pills but I couldn't, I couldn't leave the house.	Chief Complaint
So I didn't, I didn't get anything.	Chief Complaint
And when you say about getting some pills, would that be to take an overdose of tablets? Yeah.	Chief Complaint
But you've not actually done anything about that so far? No.	Chief Complaint
Ok.	Others
In the past have you ever had any problems either with your temper or getting into fights, being aggressive either with your roommates, or anybody else? No, I'm not that kind of person.	Chief Complaint
I don't want to, I don't want to hurt anybody but they're just driving me to this.	Chief Complaint
Can I just check again, you've not been in trouble with the police, or anything like that? No, never.	Chief Complaint
Ok. With all this that's going on, is there anywhere at the moment, that you feel safe? Yeah, my parent's house.	Chief Complaint
Right, okay.	Others
And have you seen much of your parents recently? Yeah.	Chief Complaint
I thought about going back there but I don't want to drag them into this.	Chief Complaint
I don't want the CIA knowing about them.	Chief Complaint
Right and throughout this last couple of months, when you've had all these worries, have you ever worried that your parents might, in some way, be involved in this conspiracy? I thought about it but no.	Chief Complaint
Ok. Can I just check out a couple of background things with you? Your general health is that ok? You're generally fit and well? Yeah, I'm.	Chief Complaint
I'm not ill.	Chief Complaint
I don't, there's nothing wrong with me.	Chief Complaint
It's just this thing in my head.	Chief Complaint
And you're not on any regular medication from your own doctor, at this stage? No, I don't take any pills.	Medical History
Ok. What about other drugs and by that I'm meaning alcohol, cannabis, heroine, ecstasy pills, anything else? Well, I don't, I don't drink much alcohol.	Client Details
And what about drugs like cannabis? Is my mom going to know about this? No.	Client Details
It's important that I hear about this.	Chief Complaint
This wouldn't be something that we would be discussing with your mom.	Chief Complaint
I smoke weed sometimes and cigarettes if I can get them.	Client Details
Ok, Would that be regular use or most days? Yeah.	Client Details
And how much would you be spending on weed or cigarettes? I don't know I get like a	Client Details
I get like a ten bag or a pack and it lasts me a day or so.	Client Details
Ok.	Others
So you have a 'ten bag' lasting you a day, of weed.	Client Details
A pack of cigarettes a day.	Client Details
Any other drugs? I'm thinking in particular, things like pills? No other drugs.	Client Details
Ok. Is that on a regular basis? I'd just go out with my friends on the weekend and we'd do a bit of weed but	Social History
Ok.	Others
When was the last time that you would have had any weed or cigarettes? About a week or so ago for weed and maybe yesterday for cigarettes.	Client Details
Right, any other drugs at all? No no.	Client Details
But I know what you're getting at though.	Chief Complaint
It's not, it's not the drugs.	Chief Complaint
It doesn't matter how out of my face I get.	Chief Complaint
Yeah, this is constantly there, it's always there.	Chief Complaint
Ok.	Others
I guess the reason why I was checking I think that's what you've picked up on, is that sometimes when people are having the kinds of experiences that you are.	Chief Complaint
they find that if they take certain drugs it can make things feel a lot worse.	Chief Complaint
I just wanted to check that it hadn't been your experience? No.	Chief Complaint
Ok.	Others
I appreciate from what you're saying that you're really very worried about this CIA conspiracy and that's the cause of the difficulties that you're having at the moment.	Chief Complaint
I just wanted to check with you, do you think it could be due to anything else? I mean, I've obviously met people who have had similar experiences and sometimes they're extremely stressed, some people might be actually mentally unwell and just whether any of these things might be relevant to you at the moment? No, because I'm not ill.	Chief Complaint
Right.	Others
It's them.	Chief Complaint
And I've read books on this as well, I don't the government know about them.	Chief Complaint
They know that they do this to loads of people and I don't know how they can get away with it.	Chief Complaint
And I've done nothing wrong.	Chief Complaint
I don't know why they're doing this to me.	Chief Complaint
I just want I just want it to stop.	Chief Complaint
Ok, sure and I think I can appreciate that.	Chief Complaint
I guess what I'm wondering is whether you think there's anything that someone like me might be able to do to help you as a doctor? That sometimes meeting someone like a psychiatrist, or having medication or for some people even coming into hospital, for a short time might be helpful.	Chief Complaint
Do you think any of those things would help you at the moment? I don't, I don't know.	Chief Complaint
I mean, I'm only here really because of my mom.	Family History
I tried to, I don't want to worry her.	Family History
I've tried to talk to her about it and she doesn't understand, she doesn't really believe me.	Chief Complaint
I mean Do you believe me? Well I certainly believe that you're having a really difficult time at the moment.	Chief Complaint
I guess, what I'm not as sure about is what's causing this.	Chief Complaint
I'm less sure that this is due to the CIA.	Chief Complaint
I guess what I'm wondering is that perhaps you're not as well as you might be at the moment.	Chief Complaint
I mean, we've been through a lot of questions and what I'm thinking is we need to try and come up with a way of supporting you through this.	Chief Complaint
So I'm wondering, because I know your mom is	Chief Complaint
I think she's waiting in the waiting room.	Chief Complaint
It might be a good chance now to get your mom in and then perhaps the three of us can put our heads together, have a discussion about where to go from here and try and think of getting you some proper support.	Chief Complaint
Ok.	Others
# Matt T11
Hello there, I'm one of the new physicians in the practice First of all, what would you like me to call you? Oh, June's fine, yeah.	Client Details
Ok.	Others
Right, so what is it that's brought you to see me today? Well, it's the same thing that I see Dr. Jones about, it's my heart.	Medical History
Yeah, yeah, I understand that you've been in to see him a few times over the last few months.	Medical History
Would you mind if I ask you to go over again what the problem is, perhaps in your own words so that I get an understanding of it? No, not at all, it's just I keep getting these situations where my heart starts to really, really race like boom, boom.	Chief Complaint
Right, I get chest pain, I can't catch my breath.	Chief Complaint
It's making me feel funny talking to you about it.	Chief Complaint
And, um, so my heart starts to race, I can't get my breath and then I get chest pains and I get very afraid that, I'm going to have a heart attack.	Chief Complaint
Right, and you're feeling a little bit anxious just here with me? I am, Ok. yeah, just talking about it.	Chief Complaint
I can feel it starting to come up.	Chief Complaint
Right, take your time.	Others
So, your heart starts to race, it really beats really fast and you feel like you can't catch your breath, is that right? Yeah, that's exactly it.	Chief Complaint
How long's all this been going on for? I think it's probably about six months, basically, yeah.	Chief Complaint
Right, Ok and can you remember what happened to start it all off? Well, I think, we have had some problems at work.	Chief Complaint
I've felt more stressed about work than I normally do, and basically, I was just trying to get into town one day on a day off and it was very hot, one of those funny hot days, and it just happened my heart started to race and race and race and I couldn't get my breath.	Chief Complaint
I was just, like, gasping for breath, then I started to get chest pains and it was just awful.	Chief Complaint
And I managed to sit down and call my husband and he came out, he actually left work to come and get me.	Chief Complaint
So that sounds like quite an unpleasant experience for you, at the time.	Chief Complaint
It was awful, it was really, really frightening,	Chief Complaint
And when that was happening to you? When you were in the middle of town, what was it that you thought was going on? I thought I was having a heart attack.	Chief Complaint
I am only 25.	Client Details
You thought you were having a heart attack? I really did, yeah, and each time it happens I'm so afraid that that is what's happening.	Chief Complaint
Ok.	Others
So, you know, I started to try and avoid situations where I might get like that, basically.	Chief Complaint
Right, so what kind of things are you finding yourself avoiding? I can't get into town now without my husband taking me because my husband has to take me to and from work and I also thought I shouldn't do anything to put any strain on my heart at all, so I don't do much exercise or anything at the moment, and other things as well.	Chief Complaint
And other things, what sort of other things are you not doing? Well, just some personal things.	Chief Complaint
Personal things, ok.	Others
I guess, I'm wondering if you're talking about your sex life there? Yeah, Right.	Client Details
I just feel that I shouldn't, you know, do anything like that because it just might put too much strain on me.	Chief Complaint
Right, so you're avoiding sex in case that puts your heart rate up? Yeah, yeah.	Chief Complaint
Ok, ok. How's that affecting things between you and your husband? It's not, I mean, yeah, my husband's getting really fed up with it, to be honest doctor.	Family History
He's been really, really kind and really supportive but I think it's starting to affect his life quite a lot now.	Family History
He wanted me to go to the pub last week, and I absolutely promised that I would, because I'd begun to stop wanting to go out because I'm so afraid it's going to happen and I promised and promised him I'd go to the pub and then when it came to it I just couldn't, I just sat on the sofa and it started to happen again.	Social History
Right, and then I was worried if I went to the pub I'd actually get ill in the pub and then it'd be really embarrassing for everybody so I just said I couldn't go, and I think he's getting a bit to the end of his tether now, because it just seems to have come out of the blue, and I've never suffered from anything like this before.	Chief Complaint
So it sounds like he's getting to the end of his tether, but it also sounds like you're pretty fed up with the whole thing as well.	Chief Complaint
is that right? Yeah, I am actually, yeah, yeah.	Chief Complaint
Ok, so just so that I've got the story straight, this all began about 6 months ago, before that had you had anything like this? No, not at all, I mean, I think we had a new manager at work, I work in a bank actually, and then we had a new computer system put in and so it became very much more stressful for all the staff not just me.	Chief Complaint
I can sort of see I was under a lot more pressure.	Chief Complaint
that could be affecting me.	Chief Complaint
So just to make sure I've got the right way around it, it began 6 months ago, pressure at work? Yeah.	Chief Complaint
You went to town, you had the first of these attacks, and then since then you've had some more of them? Yeah, yeah	Chief Complaint
And now it's kind of got to the point where you don't want to go out? I don't, no.	Chief Complaint
You don't go to town by yourself? No, I don't want to risk it to be honest.	Chief Complaint
Right.	Others
You're not going to the pub, you're not socializing like you used to? No, no.	Social History
And you're avoiding things like exercise and things like sex, and that's having a bit of a taking its toll on your relationship? It is a bit, yeah.	Chief Complaint
Ok, ok. and looking at you, I know you've had an ECG.	Medical History
Yeah, yeah	Others
What have you been told about the results of that? Well, I was told that it was ok - and there were no problems.	Medical History
You know, I did feel relief you know because obviously there has been heart attacks in my family, my dad died of one, you know, at 72.	Family History
So I'm thinking it must be my heart, there must be something wrong with it.	Chief Complaint
Right and I did feel pleased when the doctor said that, but on the other hand nothing's changed, you know, I'm still getting exactly the same problems, Right nothing, you know, I'm not getting any help with it, I just feel a bit like, well, so I haven't got a bad heart according to the experts, but I'm still getting all the same symptoms and they're getting worse and worse.	Chief Complaint
So even though the doctor told you there's nothing to worry about with your heart, do you still worry that there might be something wrong with your heart? I do, I just can't understand it, what do you think it is, doctor? Well, I think I'd agree with the doctor, I don't think there is anything wrong with your heart.	Chief Complaint
The reason I say that is that you've had an ECG which has come back perfectly normal, and usually if there was a problem with the heart the ECG would pick something up, also, you've got none of the risk factors, really, for heart disease because you don't smoke, your blood pressure from what I can gather from your notes has always been fine, you're fairly young, before this you were pretty fit and active, and also, I know you're worried about your dad having had a heart attack, but actually, he was a lot older than you are, and so you're not really in the same risk bracket as he would've been.	Chief Complaint
So, I don't think that there is a problem with your heart, I guess what I'm wondering is whether actually what's going on is a little more what the doctor thought, whether actually this might be the anxiety that's giving you a lot of these symptoms.	Chief Complaint
Have you ever thought it might be something else rather than a heart problem? I think I've been thinking more recently, it could be, because my friend has panic attacks - and I've discussed it with her and she said, to be honest it just sounds like that.	Chief Complaint
I've always thought it was my heart, and what I can't understand is how my brain is making my heart start racing like it is.	Chief Complaint
Right, ok. Has anyone explained to you about anxiety and panic attacks? Not really, no.	Medical History
What we have on top of our kidneys is two little glands, and they're called our adrenal glands, -Right, and they produce a hormone called adrenaline, have you heard of that? Yes, I have heard of that.	Others
Ok. And what adrenaline does is it prepares us for situations of fight or flight, is that a term you perhaps remember from biology at school? I do, I do, yeah, I do remember that.	Others
Do you remember what we mean by fight or flight? I think like if you're in a scary situation you either fight or run away basically.	Others
Yeah, your body sort of triggers that to do it.	Others
That's exactly it, and what's released to allow you to do the fight or flight response is the adrenaline, - Right, so when your body needs you to get ready to do something, it surges out a load of adrenaline, and the adrenaline basically gets you ready for action, right, so it does things like it gets your heart rate up, it gets your breathing speed up, so that you're ready to run, it can sometimes make people feel as though their mouth is dry, it can sometimes make people feel a bit lightheaded.	Others
Are those the kind of symptoms that you can get? Yeah definitely, yeah definitely, all of those actually.	Others
Ok. What often happens with people with panic is that the first time that happens, the first adrenaline release occurs out of the blue, and perhaps at times of stress, and you mentioned that there was stuff going on at work, you're feeling a bit stressed out, and in town it was a bit hot - so that may have been what was behind that first panic attack.	Chief Complaint
What happens to people is that once they've had one panic attack they go on to have more, and the reason for that is that once you've had something like that happen to you, you're kind of there thinking, 'ooh will this happen again.' Is that something that you do? Oh, absolutely.	Chief Complaint
I've started to really monitor my heart, and when it starts to race I start to get worried, and then it starts getting faster and faster, so it does feel.	Chief Complaint
You're describing it exactly, that's what we call hypervigilance, so you're there kind of keeping a bit of an eye on your heart?	Chief Complaint
Yeah definitely.	Others
And for most of us our heart rate will go up and down all through the day, but most of us don't worry about it because we don't notice it, but because you've had a panic attack, you're there thinking 'ooh what's my heart doing?'	Chief Complaint
And then the minute it starts to change you clock it, you notice it, and then you start to get anxious thoughts, so you might start worrying.	Chief Complaint
I really do start worrying, yes so I keep thinking is it going to be now, you know is my heart going to stop beating.	Chief Complaint
Right, so you get those kinds of anxious thoughts.	Chief Complaint
Yeah, yeah.	Others
And they're very frightening, and because you're thinking 'goodness me, could my heart stop? ', that's making you more anxious, and that causes even more adrenaline to be released, and that makes the symptoms even more pronounced, and that makes you believe even more that there's something wrong with you.	Chief Complaint
Does that make sense, as to what might be happening? It does make sense doctor.	Chief Complaint
One of the things that you have been doing, which is something a lot of people with anxiety do, is that you've started to avoid doing things that trigger it off.	Chief Complaint
I have, yeah, like not walking to town or anything; I just won't do it anymore.	Chief Complaint
Exactly, and whilst in the short term that alleviates your symptoms because you don't have to get panicky, what's happening is that the more you avoid doing things, the less likely you are to ever get around to ever finding out whether or not anything awful really happens.	Chief Complaint
Right, yeah, right.	Others
Does that make sense? It does, it does make sense.	Chief Complaint
Well, if we are starting to tackle this as if it were an anxiety problem, there are a number of approaches.	Chief Complaint
We can think about tablets, we can think about other kind of talking approaches.	Chief Complaint
There are pros and cons to those, and side effects that we need to discuss.	Chief Complaint
So, I'm just slightly watchful of the time.	Chief Complaint
We seem to be coming to the end of today's session for the appointment.	Others
Oh right, OK.	Others
But what I wonder is whether we should meet again, perhaps next week, and look again more carefully at some of the treatment options, and think together about which might suit you best. How would that sound? Oh that's fine, that's fine.	Client Details
Any other questions before we finish? No, I'll make an appointment to see you next week.	Client Details
That's fine, and I'll see you next week.	Client Details
Ok, thank you Doctor.	Others
# Matt T12
Hello, do you want to come and have a seat? Hi I'm the psychiatric doctor, what is your name? You can call me Cathy.	Client Details
Where you are located? Currently, I am staying in an apartment at South Park.	Client Details
Ok, so what's brought you here today? My sister's noticed, I'm just a bit fed up really with some mood swings.	Chief Complaint
My sister said I should come.	Client Details
Right ok. Has this been going on for some time? Yeah, a few months really.	Chief Complaint
Ok, do you want to tell me a bit more about what's been going on? Just things, things seem to be piling up.	Chief Complaint
- Right - I just don't seem to be coping with things, - Right - the kids and things and other stuff, just my mind starts to drift away.	Chief Complaint
Right, Ok. Would it be OK for me to ask you a few more detailed questions about how you've been feeling? Uhuh, - Ok.	Chief Complaint
Well if we start with asking you a bit about your mood.	Chief Complaint
How have you been feeling in yourself? I say a bit fed up.	Chief Complaint
I get up in the morning, everything seems very black.	Chief Complaint
- Right - It's like, it's just like swimming in.	Chief Complaint
I think by tea time when the kids get home, I've been having fairly decent conversation with them but my mind starts to drift away and just can't focus really.	Chief Complaint
Right, and can I just check when you say things feel very black, do you feel very miserable? Fed up, miserable, yes.	Chief Complaint
Can you brief me your any other medical issues. Nope, as such.	Medical History
Can you tell me what's the time now? My watch is actually showing 12.30 P.M.	Chief Complaint
Thanks.	Others
Do you have any sort of hallucination and delusion? No.	Chief Complaint
No.	Others
Nothing like that, just feels miserable.	Chief Complaint
Right, OK. And what about sort of feeling tearful? Has that been happening? I dropped some sugar the other day and I just burst into tears.	Chief Complaint
Right, OK. - Thanks - So is it the slightest thing that will make you tearful, things that perhaps wouldn't ordinarily bother you? Yeah my sister's noticed it as well.	Chief Complaint
Right, OK.	Others
So you've been feeling very low with episodes of tearfulness, what about other things, your energy levels, are you managing to keep up with things? I used to do a lot with the kids I used to go swimming, playing but now I just spend the day on the sofa unless I have to go to work.	Chief Complaint
Right, just remind me, what is it you do for your job? I work in a supermarket.	Client Details
Right, so how have you been managing at work? I've not been going in as much cause I just feel so exhausted but I'm just not the supermarket's been taken over and they've cut the wages - and I've had problems with the bills 3:07 and its like catalogues just writing me letters, - Uhuh - you know the kids they want all these new games and stuff - Yeah sure - and it's just you know.	Chief Complaint
Things are difficult all round then.	Chief Complaint
So with all this going on how are you sleeping? It just takes me ages to go to sleep, I used to read a book - and just drop off, but now I just spend my time looking at the clock as it goes round and round.	Chief Complaint
So from actually getting off to bed and getting off to sleep how long is that taking? Couple of hours probably.	Chief Complaint
Right, OK. - Once you're asleep are you waking up much during the night? I wake up about last night I think it was about 4 o clock I woke up.	Chief Complaint
Right - And can you get back to sleep from that time? No, no.	Chief Complaint
And then you're actually getting out of bed in the morning, are you still feeling tired at that point? I'm just exhausted, I feel like my brain's not been switched off.	Chief Complaint
I'm just exhausted the next day.	Chief Complaint
What about eating what's your appetite been like while you've been feeling like this? I used to have quite a weight problem, but the last couple of months this is a bit looser.	Chief Complaint
Right.	Others
Do you know how much weight you've lost? I am not quite sure about it.	Chief Complaint
Do you think that your kids do bother you anyway. The kids come in from school and they make their own stuff and I just don't bother really.	Chief Complaint
Okay so you're appetite's gone down as well.	Chief Complaint
What about things like concentrating and your memory? Both when you're watching TV at home and when you're out doing your job? Well, it's like the television; I used to like watching the soaps, or something like that and now 10 minutes later I'm thinking of something else, my mind drifts off.	Chief Complaint
I just started one job, and, I'm not explaining myself very well.	Chief Complaint
Okay, How your kids are doing? Useless, well I mean pretty useless with the kids.	Social History
I forgot the swimming money last week to pay, the school fees and stuff.	Chief Complaint
And what about things you used to enjoy, are there things in life that you still enjoy at the moment? Nothing really, as I say, a bit useless with the kids.	Chief Complaint
I used to enjoy going out, I used to go out with my friends, the pictures and things, but of course now I can't be bothered.	Chief Complaint
Is it that you can't be bothered and you don't feel like it as well? What's the point really? Right, okay.	Chief Complaint
And I was going to ask, how old are your children now? I had them a bit later in life, it's took a long time to have them.	Family History
I got a girl and a boy, one's 11 and one's 9.	Family History
And looking after children takes a lot of time and energy, how are you managing to keep up with that feeling as low as you do? Well they're a bit self-sufficient really the kids, they come in from school get their own tea.	Chief Complaint
I should be doing more for them really but I'm not I'm just a bit useless at that at the moment.	Chief Complaint
Ok, and what about looking after yourself? Well you can see I'm just a mess.	Chief Complaint
Dave used to say, that's my boyfriend, Right, he used to, you know, not have much money but I'd take a bit of pride in what I was doing.	Family History
My hair and stuff but I can't be bothered with that now, there's no point really.	Chief Complaint
Okay.	Others
And you mentioned Dave, that's your current partner, how long have you and Dave been together? About a year I met him at work.	Family History
And how are things, because often when people feel really down it has an impact on everything including their relationships so how are things with you and Dave at the moment? He's not ringing as much, he used to text, he's getting fed up with me not wanting to go out and things.	Chief Complaint
It's a slightly embarrassing thing to ask about but I guess it's important, often when people are really feeling very low it affects everything in the relationship including things like their sex life.	Chief Complaint
Have you noticed any changes there for you? He's always trying to pressure me a little bit - Right - and stuff, but I'm really not into that at the moment.	Chief Complaint
Right, Okay.	Others
You just don't feel like that at the moment.	Chief Complaint
No.	Others
Okay, So can I just a recap to check I've got this right, for the last few months you've been feeling really down, no energy, problems with your sleeping and eating, problems with concentrating, not really enjoying things and actually struggling a bit with the kids and perhaps some difficulties in your relationship with Dave.	Chief Complaint
Have I got that right? Hmm.	Others
Okay, Can I ask in the past have there ever been episodes where you've felt like this? When my husband left, I was always crying then for no particular reason. Right I haven't told anybody this before but I took some tablets.	Chief Complaint
Right, So how long ago are you talking? Was this a few years ago? About four years ago.	Chief Complaint
Okay, so you took some tablets, Yeah.	Chief Complaint
Can you tell me, is it alright to tell me a little bit more about that? You know what it's like, the kids are in bed and you're on your own and I had a few glasses of wine and I just took these tablets.	Chief Complaint
Okay.	Others
Can you remember what you actually took at the time what sort of tablets they were? They were just in the bathroom cabinet, it was paracetamol.	Chief Complaint
Okay.	Others
So you took some paracetamol, can you remember roughly how many you took? About 2 strips, about 12.	Chief Complaint
Right	Others
Okay.	Others
And you'd had a couple of glasses of wine; did you take anything else, any other tablets with it? No.	Chief Complaint
Okay.	Others
And was this something that you'd thought about for a while or was it a spur of the moment that evening? As I say I was crying a lot but I think it was just the wine.	Chief Complaint
Right, Okay.	Others
But you know, I'm just a bit of a burden to everybody really.	Chief Complaint
And was there any other thing that you did around the time, sometimes when people take tablets they leave a note, or do other kind a final act, get their affairs in order? Did you do any of those things? No, I just thought, that you know, I'd take the tablets and I'd just go to sleep.	Chief Complaint
Right, okay.	Others
So did you have any thoughts about what taking the tablets would do? Did you? I just thought I'd go to sleep and not wake up, but I woke up a couple of hours later and was sick everywhere.	Chief Complaint
God I was sick and miserable.	Chief Complaint
Okay.	Others
So I actually just want to check I get this right because it's important.	Chief Complaint
You actually thought that they would kill you at the time? I just didn't want to wake up, as I say, I'm just useless, I'm a useless mum now and I was then.	Chief Complaint
Right	Others
Okay.	Others
So you took the tablets and you were very sick in the night.	Chief Complaint
Did you seek any medical help at the time? No	Chief Complaint
Okay.	Others
And then were you Okay the following day? Well, yeah, I just felt a bit of a twit really.	Chief Complaint
Okay.	Others
Right.	Others
Did you feel pleased you were still alive? Yeah, I think you know I realized it was me just being silly.	Chief Complaint
Right.	Others
Okay.	Others
So that was a few years ago, if we just come back to how you are feeling at the moment, you talked about feeling very low.	Chief Complaint
Have there been times currently when you've thought about either taking an overdose or doing something else to harm yourself in any way? You know at night when, when you're watching the clock and you know, you're on your own -Yeah and the kids are in bed.	Chief Complaint
It is, just everything's so hard, and yeah I suppose, you know, it just feels easy you know? - Right	Chief Complaint
And has that just been something you've thought about or have you actually made any plans, got any tablets in or done anything else? No, nothing like that.	Chief Complaint
Okay.	Others
And I guess it's a difficult question to ask but one we would ask everybody in your situation.	Chief Complaint
Have things ever been so bad you felt so low that you've not only thought about harming yourself or perhaps killing yourself but you've also wondered whether the best thing might be to take the children with you? No, I'd never do anything with my kids I love my kids.	Chief Complaint
No I wouldn't hurt them.	Chief Complaint
Okay.	Others
And what about the other side of that, positive things, things to live for things that you feel good about? Not much at the moment I suppose, kids sometimes you know.	Chief Complaint
They do things that make you think, you know, what's good about life - Right - and things but and are there other things that help at the moment, I'm thinking about people that could be supportive? My sister as I say she said to get down here and she's always there, she comes down - Yeah and rings.	Family History
I've got a couple of friends they're quite good, Right.	Social History
Dave when he's in the mood of course but I don't think he's not going to be around for much longer.	Social History
Right, and do you think, or do you feel able to keep yourself safe at the moment from hurting yourself? I think so yeah, I know I can come here now; you've been very good today.	Chief Complaint
Okay.	Others
Do you think if that was to change so that you didn't feel able to keep yourself safe, you'd be able to let anybody know? All I know is what happened last time that was nothing and I was silly then so I know to come here.	Chief Complaint
Right, Okay.	Others
Well thanks for going through all that, I can appreciate it must be very painful.	Chief Complaint
It does sound to me that you are suffering from symptoms that strongly suggest that you are actually depressed, anxious, mood disorder at the moment.	Chief Complaint
Now I'm not sure how much you know about depression? Not much really, not much but I know I just don't feel right at the moment.	Chief Complaint
Okay so you are alert and oriented.	Chief Complaint
Well I guess just briefly depression can cause a number of problems for people and traditionally we think about people feeling very low and very miserable and often you know thinking about hurting themselves which is self-hurting behaviour with mood swings and erratic behaviours.	Chief Complaint
But it can also affect all other areas of life in terms of problems with eating and sleeping and the other problems you've noticed is that concentration and perhaps not really managing as well as normal.	Chief Complaint
I guess the positive side is that you've done something about it and you've come to talk to me about it today and I think there are almost certainly a range of things we can put in place to help you and treatments that are available.	Chief Complaint
So I guess what I'm thinking is it might be worth us spending a few minutes just thinking about those options for you so that we can start to improve things for you.	Chief Complaint
Would that be alright with you? I need to do this, yes; I think that's sensible yeah.	Chief Complaint
